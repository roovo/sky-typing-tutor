# CLAUDE.md — Sky Language Project

This is a [Sky](https://github.com/anzellai/sky) project. Sky is a pure
functional, ML-family language compiling to Go (with surface syntax that
is Elm-compatible). The compiler is written in Haskell (GHC 9.4+) and
ships as a single `sky` binary. Users only need the `sky` binary and
Go 1.21+ — no Haskell toolchain required to use Sky.

**Core principle: if it compiles, it works.** Every side effect flows
through `Task`, every fallible value returns `Result Error a`, and
`sky check` invokes `go build` on the emitted Go so any shape mismatch
surfaces at check time. No runtime panics from well-typed Sky code, no
nil leakage, no silent numeric coercion.

**Typed Go output.** Generated Go functions have fully-typed
signatures end-to-end. Type-directed lowering propagates the slot's
expected type into lambda bodies, record-field inits, list elements,
and call args — so `{ onSubmit = \s -> Tag ("L:" ++ s), ... }` against
`Cfg Msg` emits `func(string) Msg`, not `func(any) any`. Parametric
record aliases compile to Go generics (`type Cfg_R[T1 any] struct{...}`
with per-instance type args). Tail-recursive Sky functions auto-TCO to
`for { ... continue }` Go loops (constant stack). Whole-program DCE
prunes unused Go code + unused FFI bindings. Browse the full API
surface with `sky doc --serve`.

```go
func f(name string, age int) rt.SkyResult[Error, Profile_R] { ... }
func do[T1 any](result rt.SkyResult[Error, T1], fn func(T1) rt.SkyResult[Error, rt.SkyValue]) rt.SkyResult[Error, rt.SkyValue] { ... }
```

Type annotations on your functions are load-bearing — if you write
`f : String -> Int -> Result Error Profile` and the body would
otherwise infer to something wider, the compiler rejects the body.
Inline records in function annotations aren't supported — use a
`type alias` for any record you want in a signature.

## CLARIFY BEFORE YOU SCAFFOLD — mandatory protocol

**You (the AI assistant) must reach alignment with the user on six
decisions before writing more than a one-file proof of concept.**
Skipping this step ships generic, hard-to-deploy code. Use whatever
question surface your tool exposes (AskUserQuestion in Claude Code,
structured numbered list otherwise) — but ask, do not assume.

### The six decisions

1. **App shape** (the architecture surface).  Match the matrix below.
2. **Persistence** — SQLite (single-file, embeds) / PostgreSQL
   (Cloud SQL / managed) / Firestore / Redis / none.
3. **Auth** — none / `Std.Auth` (cookies + JWT, you own users) /
   OAuth (Google / GitHub via Go SDK) / external (Auth0 / Clerk /
   Cognito).
4. **Sky.Live session store** (only if app shape is Sky.Live or
   embeds Sky.Live) — memory (dev only) / sqlite (single host,
   persistent) / redis (multi-instance horizontal scale) /
   postgres (multi-instance, share DB with app data) / firestore
   (GCP serverless).
5. **Deployment target** — local binary / Docker / Cloud Run via
   SkyDeploy / Kubernetes / VM under systemd.
6. **Observability scope** — local logs only / per-app embedded
   console / push to central `sky console-serve` hub / external
   OTel collector (Honeycomb / Tempo / Datadog).

### App shape decision matrix

| User wants…                              | Use                | Entry point shape                  | Notes |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------|-------|
| Web app (forms, real-time, UI state)     | **Sky.Live**       | `Std.Live.app cfg`                 | HTTP-first; SSE patches; sessions + cookies + routing built in. |
| HTTP / JSON API (no browser UI)          | **Sky.Http.Server**| `Server.listen 8000 [...]`         | Routes + middleware (CORS, rate-limit, logging, basic-auth). |
| Multi-tenant SaaS / dashboard            | **Sky.Live + auth-app gate** | `Live.app { consoleAuth = … }` | Pair with `sky console-serve` hub for shared telemetry. |
| Background job / cron worker             | **Sky.Cli**        | `main = Task.run scheduledWork`    | No UI loop; long-running goroutines via `Task.parallel`. |
| Terminal UI (TUI)                        | **Sky.Tui**        | `Std.Tui.app cfg`                  | Same view code as Sky.Live; renders to ANSI cells. |
| One-shot CLI tool                        | **Sky.Cli**        | `main = Task.run cliCmd`           | Argparse via `System.args`. |
| Desktop app                              | **Sky.Webview**    | `Std.Webview.app cfg`              | macOS in v0.1; Linux / Windows in v0.2. |
| WebSocket-driven feed (chat, multiplayer)| **Sky.Http.Server.WebSocket** or **Sky.Live + WS sub** | `Server.upgrade req` | Bidirectional; nhooyr.io/websocket. |
| Server-sent stream (LLM tokens, SSE)     | **Sky.Http.Server.Stream** | `Server.Stream.emit` | Mirror of `Sky.Core.Http.Stream` consumer. |

### Pinned defaults (always apply unless the user overrules)

* **View layer** — `Std.Ui` (typed no-CSS DSL).  Renders to HTML
  (Sky.Live), ANSI (Sky.Tui), or native Webview from the same
  source.  Reach for `Std.Html` only when wrapping raw markup the
  user already wrote.
* **Auth** — `Std.Auth.{register, login, setRole, signToken,
  verifyToken, hashPassword, verifyPassword}`.  bcrypt + HS256 JWT
  cookies.  NEVER log a password, NEVER `fmt.Sprintf("%v", secret)`.
* **Forms with password fields** — `Ui.form [Ui.onSubmit DoSignIn]`
  with a typed record arg.  NEVER `onInput UpdatePassword` per
  keystroke (defeats password managers + leaks the value into
  Model + the session store).
* **DB** — `Std.Db` with SQLite for prototypes / single-host;
  PostgreSQL when the user says "deployment" / "multi-instance" /
  "scale".  Migrations via `sky db migrate` + the `_sky_migrations`
  ledger.
* **Numeric money** — `Std.Money` (currency-typed) on `Std.Decimal`.
  NEVER raw `Float` for currency.  Banker's rounding by default.
* **Concurrency** — `Cmd.batch` / `Task.parallel` for parallel
  effects; `Sub.subscribeTopic` + `Cmd.publish` for in-process
  pub/sub.  Both run under the Sky.Live update loop without race
  conditions.
* **Observability** — Sky.Live + Sky.Http.Server auto-mount
  `/_sky/console`, `/_sky/metrics`, `/_sky/healthz`, `/_sky/readyz`,
  `/_sky/buildinfo`.  In production gate them via
  `SKY_CONSOLE_AUTH=app` + your `consoleAuth` callback.  Push to a
  shared hub with `SKY_CONSOLE_HUB` + `SKY_CONSOLE_HUB_TOKEN` when
  multiple apps.
* **Errors** — `Result Error a` / `Task Error a`.  NEVER `String`
  as an error type.  NEVER throw a panic in Sky source — panic
  recovery is for FFI / runtime bugs, not user code.
* **No raw HTML / JS strings in view code.** `Std.Ui` already
  HTML-escapes every value.  Accessibility lives in `Std.Ui.Region`
  (real `<h1>` / `<main>` / `<nav>` / `<footer>` + `aria-*`).
  `data-sky-eval` is forbidden — use `data-sky-path` for URL
  sync and named typed attrs for everything else.

### sky.toml — the right shape per decision

After the user answers the six decisions, write `sky.toml`
deterministically:

```toml
name = "<project-name>"
version = "0.1.0"
entry = "src/Main.sky"

[live]                          # only if app shape = Sky.Live
port = 8000
store = "sqlite"                # memory / sqlite / redis / postgres / firestore
storePath = "sessions.db"       # path / connection string per store
ttl = "30m"

[database]                      # only if persistence != none
driver = "sqlite"               # sqlite / postgres
url = "DATABASE_URL"            # env-var reference for production

[auth]                          # only if auth != none
cookie = "sky_sid"
ttl = "24h"
# secret comes from SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET — never commit it

[log]
format = "json"
level  = "info"
```

Add `[env] prefix = "MYAPP"` only if the user is running multiple
Sky apps in the same process group and needs namespaced env vars.

### Production gate — surface to the user

Sky locks down the dev console + banner + metrics endpoint when
`ENV` is anything other than unset / `dev` / `development` /
`local`.  When the user mentions "deploy" / "production" / "Cloud
Run" / "Kubernetes":

* Confirm `ENV=production` is set on the runtime.
* Confirm `SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET` is at least 32 bytes (Sky errors
  at startup if shorter).
* Confirm `SKY_CONSOLE_AUTH` is set (token or app); production
  with `SKY_CONSOLE_AUTH` unset emits a warn log and refuses to
  mount `/_sky/console`.
* Confirm session store is NOT memory if there will be more than
  one replica.

### When you are unsure — say so

If the user's request is ambiguous, the right move is **one
focused clarifying question per ambiguity**, not a heroic guess.
Examples of ambiguity that warrant a question:

* "build me a CRM" → which entity types?  which auth?  which deploy
  target?  ask before scaffolding.
* "add an admin dashboard" → does it live in the same Sky.Live app
  as a sub-route, or as a separate hub binary?  ask.
* "let users upload files" → max size? mime allowlist? storage
  backend (local / S3-compatible / GCS)?  ask.
* "send them an email" → which provider? `SKY_EMAIL_DRY_RUN=1` in
  dev?  ask.

**Production-grade means** the app survives a restart, scales
horizontally without losing user state, refuses cross-tenant
reads, doesn't paint a permanent error banner on transient
upstream failures, and emits structured logs every operator can
trace.  All of that is achievable with the stdlib defaults — but
only if you asked the right six questions.

## Reading order for AI assistants

If you're an AI code assistant building Sky applications on behalf of
a user, read the following sections IN ORDER before producing more
than a one-file proof of concept. Skipping ahead leads to code that
type-checks but panics at runtime — the "if it compiles, it works"
guarantee depends on you respecting a handful of idioms the
ML-family / Elm-compatible syntax makes non-obvious.

0. **CLARIFY BEFORE YOU SCAFFOLD** (above) — the six decisions the
   user MUST answer before you commit to an architecture.  Production-
   grade code is not a guess.
1. **Pinned defaults** (above) — the libraries + patterns to reach
   for without thinking, given a confirmed app shape.
2. **Cardinal Rules** (below) — 10 rules that, if you follow them,
   keep you out of 90 % of the pitfalls real Sky projects have hit.
3. **Common Pitfalls & Fixes** — error → cause → fix table.  Skim so
   user-reported messages are instantly mappable to action.
4. **Real-World App Skeletons** — complete runnable starter code for
   the most common app shapes.  Copy + adapt; do not invent from
   scratch.
5. **Standard Library — Complete API** — authoritative signatures.
   If a claim here conflicts with something you saw elsewhere, the
   stdlib section wins.
6. **Troubleshooting Cookbook** — when the user reports a specific
   error message, start here.
7. **Known Limitations** — work-arounds for things the compiler
   can't yet do.

Everything else (FFI details, sky.toml, formatter rules) is
reference, consult on-demand.

## Cardinal Rules (AI assistants: internalise before writing code)

These are non-negotiable. Violating them either fails to compile, panics at
runtime, or silently breaks a user-visible feature. Each rule has a concrete
"do this, not that" pattern to follow.

**1. Every fallible value returns `Result Error a` — never `Result String a`,
never a bare `a` that panics on error.** Sky's `Error` ADT
(from `Sky.Core.Error`) carries a structured kind (`Io`, `Network`, `Ffi`,
`InvalidInput`, `NotFound`, `PermissionDenied`, etc.) plus a message. Handlers
pattern-match on kind to decide retry behaviour and UI severity. Stringy error
types are forbidden at public surfaces and enforced by `sky verify`.

```elm
-- ✓ Do this
readConfig : String -> Result Error Config
readConfig path =
    case File.readFile path of
        Ok contents -> parseConfig contents
        Err e -> Err e   -- propagate the typed Error unchanged

-- ✗ Not this — stringy error loses the kind, breaks pattern-matching upstream
readConfig : String -> Result String Config
readConfig path = ...
```

**2. Match the annotation to the body.** When you annotate a function, the
annotation becomes the function's scheme — the body must produce that exact
type. `initSchema : Db -> Task Error ()` over a body that actually returns
`Task Error Int` (because `Db.exec` returns affected-row count) compiles
but panics at runtime when the `Int` is coerced to `()`. Either remove the
annotation (and let HM infer) or change it to match:

```elm
-- ✓ Correct
initSchema : Db -> Task Error Int    -- execRaw returns affected rows
initSchema db = Db.execRaw db "CREATE TABLE ..."

-- Or discard the count deliberately:
initSchema : Db -> Task Error ()
initSchema db =
    Db.execRaw db "CREATE TABLE ..." |> Task.map (\_ -> ())
```

**3. `Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)` does NOT re-export `Error`.** You must
explicitly import it. A project using `Result Error _` anywhere needs:

```elm
import Sky.Core.Error as Error exposing (Error(..), ErrorKind(..))
```

The `Error(..)` form exposes the constructor, `ErrorKind(..)` exposes the
eleven error kinds you pattern-match on (see Cardinal Rule 1).

**4. Store DB connections at the top level, not in `Model`.** Sky.Live
persists the Model to the session store (memory, SQLite, Redis, Postgres).
`*sql.DB` and similar opaque FFI handles have internal pointer cycles that
break gob serialization and add dead weight to every session blob. Open
once at module load via `Task.run`, fail-fast on error.

```elm
-- ✓ Do this — singleton conn forced eagerly at module init
dbConn =
    case Task.run (Db.open "sqlite" "app.db") of
        Ok conn -> conn
        Err e ->
            let _ = println ("[FATAL] " ++ Error.toString e) in
            System.exit 1

init _ = ({ messages = [], input = "" }, Cmd.none)

update msg model =
    case msg of
        SaveStuff payload ->
            ( model
            , Cmd.perform (Db.exec dbConn "INSERT ..." [payload]) Saved
            )
        Saved (Ok _) -> ({ model | notice = "Saved" }, Cmd.none)
        Saved (Err e) -> ({ model | notice = errMsg e }, Cmd.none)

-- ✗ Not this — Model can't serialise a live DB handle
type alias Model = { db : Maybe Db, messages : List Msg }
```

For long-running queries inside `update`, do not call `Db.query` directly
(it returns Task — you'd discard it). Instead `Cmd.perform (Db.query …) ResultMsg`
and handle `ResultMsg (Ok rows)` / `ResultMsg (Err e)` in the next branch.

**5. Each record type alias auto-generates a constructor.** Writing
`type alias Profile = { name : String, age : Int }` gives you
`Profile : String -> Int -> Profile` for free. Field declaration order is
positional argument order. Use it in `Result.map3` / `Decode.succeed`
pipelines without a `makeProfile` wrapper:

```elm
type alias Profile = { name : String, age : Int, email : String }

decodeProfile =
    Decode.succeed Profile
        |> Pipeline.required "name"  Decode.string
        |> Pipeline.required "age"   Decode.int
        |> Pipeline.required "email" Decode.string
```

**6. Records inside function annotations must be named.** Typed codegen
needs a struct name for emission. `f : { x : Int } -> Int` is rejected
because HM can't backfill a name. Always use a `type alias`:

```elm
-- ✓ Do this
type alias Point = { x : Int, y : Int }
distance : Point -> Float
distance p = Math.sqrt (toFloat (p.x * p.x + p.y * p.y))

-- ✗ Not this — anonymous inline record type in annotation
distance : { x : Int, y : Int } -> Float
```

**7. Every FFI call returns `Result Error T`.** The FFI boundary is a
trust boundary — Go can panic, return nil, or fail in ways HM can't see.
This applies UNIFORMLY to every FFI shape: method calls, constructors,
field getters, field setters, and package-level var reads. The generated
wrappers recover panics and surface them as `Err(ErrFfi _)`.

```elm
-- ✓ Every Go call is a Result
case Uuid.newString of
    Ok id  -> useId id
    Err _  -> fallbackId

-- ✓ Field getters return Result too — unwrap explicitly
custName =
    Result.withDefault ""
        (Stripe.checkoutSessionCustomerDetails sess
             |> Result.andThen Stripe.checkoutSessionCustomerDetailsName)

-- ✗ Don't treat getter output as bare T — will fail type check
customerDetails = Stripe.checkoutSessionCustomerDetails sess
name = Stripe.checkoutSessionCustomerDetailsName customerDetails  -- Result, not String
if name != "" then ...  -- type error
```

Pipeline-friendly setters compose naturally because each stage is a
Result and `Result.andThen` threads the receiver through:

```elm
-- ✓ Setter pipeline — each stage wraps/passes Result
OpenAi.newChatCompletionMessage ()
    |> Result.andThen (\msg -> OpenAi.chatCompletionMessageSetRole "user" msg)
    |> Result.andThen (\msg -> OpenAi.chatCompletionMessageSetContent body msg)
```

**8. Zero-arg FFI functions are values, not calls.** `Uuid.newString` is a
value (a `Result Error String`), not a function to call. Calling it as
`Uuid.newString ()` is a type error.

**9. Zero-arity Sky top-level declarations are memoised — add a `_` arg if
they read env vars.** `openDb = Db.connect ()` evaluates ONCE at first access
and caches forever. That's fine for DB handles. But a zero-arity function
reading `System.getenv` evaluates at Go `init()` time — BEFORE `.env` is loaded.
Workaround: add a dummy `_` parameter to defer the evaluation.

```elm
-- ✓ Reads env vars at each call (correct)
apiKey _ = System.getenv "OPENAI_API_KEY" |> Result.withDefault ""

-- ✗ Evaluates at init time, before .env loads
apiKey = System.getenv "OPENAI_API_KEY" |> Result.withDefault ""
```

**10. Never write FFI code by hand.** `sky add <package>` generates all
bindings with panic recovery and typed wrappers. Hand-written FFI loses the
safety net.

**11. Go-keyword names are safe — the compiler rewrites them.** A Sky
identifier in the reserved set (every Go keyword + predeclared type/func/
constant) lowers to `<name>_` in emitted Go (`init` → `init_`,
`string` → `string_`, `error` → `error_`, `for` → `for_`). The TEA idiom
`init = init`, `view = view`, `update = update` is **safe** — the LHS is a
record-field key (Go-side `Init` / `View` / `Update`, capitalised) and the
RHS is an identifier reference (Go-side `init_` / `view_` / `update_`).
Different namespaces, no collision with Go's special `func init()`.

Tier 1 (special semantics): `init`.
Tier 2 (predeclared funcs): `new`, `make`, `len`, `cap`, `copy`, `append`,
`delete`, `panic`, `recover`, `print`, `println`, `clear`, `min`, `max`,
`complex`, `imag`, `real`, `close`.
Tier 3 (reserved keywords): all 23 Go keywords (`for`, `case`, `type`, `func`,
`var`, `const`, `interface`, `struct`, `map`, `chan`, `go`, `defer`, `goto`,
`fallthrough`, `range`, `return`, `switch`, `default`, `break`, `continue`,
`import`, `package`, `select`).
Tier 4 (predeclared types + constants): `bool`, `byte`, `rune`, `string`,
`error`, `any`, `comparable`, every `int*`/`uint*`/`float*`/`complex*` size,
`true`, `false`, `iota`, `nil`.

Special-cased outside this set: `main` (program entry → Go's `func main()`).
The Sky parser rejects `if`/`else`/`nil` as identifiers before they reach
codegen.

**12. Every long-running command MUST be timeout-bounded.** Tests,
builds, sweeps, even smoke runs of `sky-out/app`. A hung subprocess
without a timeout will silently steal hours. `cabal test` runs under
`timeout 3600` (60 min ceiling); per-spec subprocess calls wrap children
in `timeout 60`; `scripts/example-sweep.sh` already enforces
`run_with_timeout 10` per example; never `wait $PID` unbounded — kill
after a finite ceiling. If a test legitimately needs more than 60 min,
that's a flaky test — bisect, don't widen.

**13. No "pre-existing" dismissal — every bug enters the pipeline.**
When you spot a test failure / sweep failure / runtime panic / log
error during dev or CI — **whether your work introduced it or it's
older than your branch** — file a task immediately. The phrases
"pre-existing flake", "defer to v0.X", "known issue, ignore" are
forbidden as shipping excuses. Workarounds in CLAUDE.md are a
temporary bridge while the actual fix is in flight, not a permanent
resolution. Only an explicit user override allows shipping with a
known unfixed issue.

## Common Pitfalls & Fixes

Reference table for the specific errors real Sky projects hit. Scan this
before writing non-trivial code.

| Symptom | Cause | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| `TYPE ERROR: Type mismatch: ( { ... }, Cmd Msg ) vs ( Model, Cmd Msg )` | `init` returns an anonymous record but annotation expects named alias | Make sure field set matches `Model` exactly; if it does and still fails, annotate `init : a -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )` to force the expectation |
| `interface conversion: interface {} is int, not struct {}` at runtime | Annotation says `Result Error ()` but body returns `Result Error Int` | Change annotation to match actual return type, or use `Result.map (\_ -> ())` to discard |
| `undefined: Error` in generated Go | Missing `import Sky.Core.Error as Error exposing (Error)` | Add the import — Prelude does not re-export it |
| Input/button renders as always-disabled | (fixed in v0.9-dev) boolean attrs now honour their value — regenerate sky-out after `sky upgrade` | — |
| `case xs of [] -> _` panics with `[]main.T, not []interface {}` | (fixed in v0.9-dev) typed list patterns | — |
| Add-a-row updates DB but page doesn't refresh | (fixed in v0.9-dev) `rt.RecordUpdate` now narrows `[]any → []T` | — |
| `stack overflow` in `walkGob` at server start | Model stores an opaque FFI handle (DB, HTTP client, Firestore client) with internal pointer cycles | Move the handle out of Model — keep it at top level (Cardinal Rule 4) |
| `not enough arguments in call to rt.Http_request` | (fixed in v0.9-dev) `Http.request` now takes a single record arg | Regenerate sky-out; use `Http.request { method, url, headers, body }` |
| `cannot use generic function init_ without instantiation` | Entry-module TypedDef referenced before its generic params were resolved | (fixed in v0.9-dev) — regenerate sky-out |
| `undefined: Sky_Core_Json_Decode_index` | (fixed in v0.9-dev) `Decode.index` now registered as a kernel function | — |
| `(\row -> { role = ..., content = ... })` parse error | Parser misaligns a multi-line lambda at a tight column | Hoist the lambda body to a top-level function, or use `\row -> { role = field row "role", content = field row "content" }` on ONE line |
| Endpoint card doesn't show when added | Model's list field typed via alias but `loadEndpoints` returns `[]any`; record-update drops the new list | (fixed in v0.9-dev) — regenerate sky-out; if still broken, check the field type matches exactly |
| `Http.request` expects 4 args instead of record | Using an old sky binary from before v0.9 record-style fix | `sky upgrade` and rebuild |
| Compiler silently accepts wrong annotation then panics at runtime | HM edge case — annotation says `Result Error ()` but body returns typed other | Remove the annotation to get the real inferred type in an error, or run with stricter annotations |
| `reflect: Call with too few input arguments` from `List.indexedMap` / `List.foldl` / `Task.andThen` | (fixed in v0.9.10) higher-order combinators now curry top-level multi-arg functions correctly. Same fix covers `Task.andThen (insertRow db)` (let-bound partial app) and `\|> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetMode "payment")` (FFI-setter pipeline) — no more inline-lambda workaround needed | — |
| `data-sky-ev-sky-image` / `data-sky-ev-sky-file` events do nothing | (fixed in v0.9.10) `onImage` / `onFile` now wire end-to-end: server emits `data-sky-ev-…`, JS file driver wraps the data URL in `[…]` to match the wire `Args` shape, `Event_onFile` runtime kernel + `fileMaxSize` attribute helper added | — |

A test module exposes a single `tests : List Test` value. `sky test <path>` compiles it alongside your project and runs every test, failing with exit 1 on any assertion failure.

```elm
module StringTest exposing (tests)

import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)
import Sky.Core.String as String
import Sky.Test as Test exposing (Test)


tests : List Test
tests =
    [ Test.test "trim removes outer spaces" (\_ ->
        Test.equal "hi" (String.trim "  hi  "))
    , Test.test "toInt rejects junk" (\_ ->
        Test.err (String.toInt "abc"))
    , Test.test "contains finds substring" (\_ ->
        Test.isTrue (String.contains "ell" "hello"))
    ]
```

Assertions: `equal`, `notEqual`, `ok`, `err`, `expectErrorKind`, `isTrue`, `isFalse`, `fail`, `pass`.

Non-regression rules (enforced by `sky verify`):

- No `Result String a` or `Task String a` in any public surface — use `Result Error a` / `Task Error a`.
- No `Std.IoError` (deleted), no `RemoteData` (deleted).
- Every bug you fix must land with a regression test in `tests/`.
- `sky check` is a full soundness gate (runs `go build` on the generated Go). Don't work around check failures by disabling it.
- Secrets (`Auth.signToken` / `Auth.verifyToken`) take `String` and reject short keys (< 32 bytes) — don't stringify a `Maybe` or `Dict` into an auth secret.
- **Security-critical Auth kernels require typed-String arguments.** `Auth.hashPassword`, `Auth.hashPasswordCost`, `Auth.passwordStrength`, `Auth.signToken`, `Auth.verifyToken`, `Auth.register`, `Auth.login`, `Auth.setRole` each gate at compile time on every String-typed slot — bridging an `any`-typed binding (`bridge : any` annotation; raw `Ffi.kernel "K"` without a signature) into any of those slots is a compile-time `Sky.Auth.UntypedBoundary` (E4006) error, not a runtime surprise. The user-visible runtime error on a non-String value is the fixed `<kernel>: expected String` blurb; the actual Go type lands in the server-side audit log (`[WARN] auth.boundary kernel=… goType=… …`), never in the API response.


## Language Syntax

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)    -- auto-imported: Result, Maybe, identity, errorToString
import Sky.Core.String as String
import Sky.Core.List as List
import Sky.Core.Dict as Dict
import Std.Log exposing (println)

-- Type annotations are optional (Hindley-Milner inference)
greet : String -> String
greet name =
    "Hello, " ++ name

-- Algebraic data types
type Shape
    = Circle Float
    | Rectangle Float Float

-- Records (type aliases)
type alias Point = { x : Int, y : Int }

-- Pattern matching (exhaustiveness checked by compiler)
area : Shape -> Float
area shape =
    case shape of
        Circle r -> 3.14 * r * r
        Rectangle w h -> w * h

-- Let-in expressions
main =
    let
        p = { x = 10, y = 20 }
        updated = { p | x = 99 }     -- immutable record update
        items = [1, 2, 3]
            |> List.map (\x -> x * 2)  -- pipeline operator
            |> List.filter (\x -> x > 3)
    in
    println ("Result: " ++ String.fromInt updated.x)
```

### Types

`Int`, `Float`, `String`, `Bool`, `Char`, `Unit` (`()`), `List a`, `Maybe a` (`Just a | Nothing`), `Result err ok` (`Ok ok | Err err`), `Dict k v`, tuples `(a, b)`, records `{ field : Type }`

### Operators

`++` (concat), `|>` `<|` (pipe), `>>` `<<` (compose), `==` `!=` `/=` `<` `>` `<=` `>=`, `&&` `||`, `+` `-` `*` `/` `//` `%`, `::` (cons)

Note: `/=` is Elm-compatible not-equal (alias for `!=`). `//` is integer division (always returns `Int`). Both forms are supported.

### Multiline Strings

Triple-quoted strings preserve newlines. Interpolation uses double braces `{{expr}}`:

```elm
html =
    """<div class="card">
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
    <p>{{description}}</p>
</div>"""

sql =
    """CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS users (
        id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
        name TEXT NOT NULL
    )"""
```

Single braces `{` are literal — safe for JavaScript, CSS, JSON, SQL. Interpolation expressions support identifiers, field access, qualified names, and function calls.

Escape with backslash: `\{{` emits a literal `{{` (no interpolation). Use this to ship Mustache / Handlebars / shell-script placeholders to downstream tooling without Sky hijacking them. `\\` collapses to a single backslash; other `\X` sequences are preserved (regex `\d+`, paths `\test`, etc).

### Patterns

Literals, constructors (`Just x`, `Ok v`, `Err e`), tuples `(a, b)`, lists `[]`, `[x]`, `x :: xs`, wildcards `_`, as-patterns `Just x as original`, nested `Ok (Just x)`

### Record Patterns

```elm
-- Record patterns (destructuring)
case user of
    { name, age } -> name ++ " is " ++ String.fromInt age

-- In function params
greet { name } = "Hello, " ++ name

-- In let bindings
let { x, y } = point in x + y
```

## Task — Effect Boundary

**Single rule (v1.0+):** every observable side effect returns `Task Error a`. That includes the previously-eager kernels: `println`, `Slog.*`, `Time.now`, `Time.unixMillis`, `System.getenv`, `System.cwd`, `System.args`. The previous "two-tier" doctrine that carved them out as sync convenience effects is gone — see "Auto-force `let _ = TaskExpr`" below for why this is now ergonomic.

Tasks are lazy — they only execute when `Task.run` / `Task.perform` is called, when consumed by `Cmd.perform`, or auto-forced via `let _ =` discard.

The narrow exception is **`System.exit`** which stays `Int -> a` (polymorphic) because it never returns — Task-wrapping it would force every case branch using it as a fatal-error escape to also be Task, with no compensating type information.

```elm
import Sky.Core.Task as Task

-- Create and compose Tasks
pipeline =
    Task.succeed "Sky"
        |> Task.andThen (\name -> Task.succeed ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!"))
        |> Task.map (\msg -> msg ++ " Pure and reliable.")

-- Execute at the boundary
result = Task.perform pipeline
-- result : Result Error String
```

**Task API:**
- `Task.succeed : a -> Task err a`
- `Task.fail : err -> Task err a`
- `Task.map : (a -> b) -> Task err a -> Task err b`
- `Task.andThen : (a -> Task err b) -> Task err a -> Task err b`
- `Task.perform : Task err a -> Result err a`
- `Task.sequence : List (Task err a) -> Task err (List a)` -- run sequentially
- `Task.parallel : List (Task err a) -> Task err (List a)` -- run concurrently (goroutines)
- `Task.lazy : (() -> a) -> Task err a` -- defer computation until executed
- For combining N independent Tasks, use `Task.parallel [ta, tb, tc] |> Task.map (\[a, b, c] -> fn a b c)` or chain via `Task.andThen`. (`Task.map2..5` / `Task.andMap` are PLANNED but not yet implemented; use `Result.map2..5` / `Result.andMap` for the Result counterparts which DO exist.)
- `Task.fromResult : Result e a -> Task e a` -- lift a Result-returning step (FFI call, parser) into a Task pipeline
- `Task.andThenResult : (a -> Result e b) -> Task e a -> Task e b` -- chain a Result-returning step after a Task
- `Result.andThenTask : (a -> Task e b) -> Result e a -> Task e b` -- chain a Task-returning step after a Result
- `Task.mapError : (e -> e2) -> Task e a -> Task e2 a` -- transform error type without touching the success path
- `Task.onError : (e -> Task e2 a) -> Task e a -> Task e2 a` -- recover from error to a new Task (HTTP error response, retry, fall back to default)

**Auto-force `let _ = TaskExpr`** (v1.0+). The compiler special-cases `let _ = X in Y` discards: when X has type `Task e a`, the lowerer emits `_ = rt.AnyTaskRun(X)` so the Task thunk is forced and the side effect fires. Without this, every kernel-Task call would silently no-op when discarded. With this, the pervasive debug-trace pattern keeps working unchanged:

```elm
let
    _ = println "step 1"        -- Task auto-forced, print fires
    _ = println "step 2"        -- same
    _ = Log.infoWith "saving" [ "id", id ]
in
    continue
```

**Top-level bindings stay explicit.** Auto-force only applies to `let _ =` discards. Reading a Task-typed value at module scope requires explicit `Task.run`:

```elm
-- Module top-level
apiKey =
    System.getenv "OPENAI_KEY"
        |> Task.run
        |> Result.withDefault ""
```

**Db.* returns Task.** `Db.connect` / `Db.open` / `Db.exec` / `Db.execRaw` / `Db.query` / `Db.queryDecode` / `Db.insertRow` / `Db.{getById, updateById, deleteById}` / `Db.{findOneByField, findManyByField, findByConditions, withTransaction}` / `Db.migrate` all return `Task Error a` and compose directly with `Task.andThen` / `Task.parallel` / `Cmd.perform`. Pure dict accessors (`Db.getField` / `getString` / `getInt` / `getBool`) stay bare — they read from a row dict, no I/O. Auth side effects (`Auth.register` / `login` / `setRole`) are Task; pure CPU ones (`Auth.hashPassword` / `verifyPassword` / `signToken` / `verifyToken`) are Result.

**Db.migrate** applies versioned, forward-only schema migrations — `migrate : Db -> List Migration -> Task Error (List String)` where `Migration = { name : String, sql : String }`. A `_sky_migrations` table tracks applied migrations by name + SQL checksum; re-running is a no-op; editing an already-applied migration is rejected (checksum guard). Call once at start-up. Forward-only — undo via a new compensating migration. Inspect or apply from the CLI with `sky db status` (reports applied / pending / drifted, exits non-zero on drift) and `sky db migrate` (applies pending, then exits) — both build the app and run its `Db.migrate` call before serving.

**Db chain (clean Task composition):**

```elm
loadUserNotes : String -> Task Error (List Note)
loadUserNotes userId =
    Db.open "sqlite" "app.db"
        |> Task.andThen (\db ->
            Db.query db "SELECT id, title, body FROM notes WHERE user_id = ?" [userId])
        |> Task.map (List.map parseNote)
```

**Two-level error handling (canonical pattern for production):**

```elm
import Sky.Core.Crypto as Crypto
import Std.Log as Log

-- Server-side: Slog with errId for ops to grep.
-- Client-side: Task.fail with same errId in user-friendly message.
withErrorReporting : String -> Task Error a -> Task Error a
withErrorReporting opName task =
    task |> Task.onError (\e ->
        Crypto.randomToken 4
            |> Task.andThen (\errId ->
                let _ = Log.errorWith opName [ "errId", errId, "error", Error.toString e ]
                in  Task.fail (Error.unexpected
                        ("Operation failed (ref " ++ errId ++ ")"))))

-- Apply at the source of effectful pipelines:
saveOrder : Order -> Task Error String
saveOrder order =
    Db.exec ... |> withErrorReporting "order.save"
```

**Bridges (when you mix Result-returning FFI with Task pipelines):**

The bridges still earn their keep for genuinely Result-returning FFI (Stripe builder pattern, JSON parsers, validators) — they're no longer needed for Db (which is now Task) but still useful when:

```elm
-- Stripe builder returns Result through |> Result.andThen chains.
-- Lift the final Result into a Task pipeline that does HTTP afterwards.
createCheckout : String -> Task Error CheckoutSession
createCheckout url =
    Stripe.newCheckoutSessionParams ()
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetMode "payment")
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetSuccessURL url)
        |> Result.andThenTask (\params ->
            Stripe.newCheckoutSession params       -- Result Error CheckoutSession
                |> Task.fromResult
                |> Task.andThen registerWebhook)   -- Task Error CheckoutSession
```

There is no `Result.fromTask` / `Task -> Result` bridge by design. `Task.run` exists for the runtime entry boundary (CLI `main`, test fixtures, Lib wrappers that need a sync result for `case`-pattern matching), but user code should keep effectful pipelines in `Task` and let the boundary (`Cmd.perform`, HTTP handler return) execute them.

**Per-app shape error handling:**
- **CLI** (`07-todo-cli`): `main = let _ = Task.run (chain |> Task.onError reportError) in ()` where `reportError` Slogs + prints to stderr + `System.exit 1`.
- **Sky.Http.Server**: handler returns `Task Error Response`; `|> Task.onError (\e -> Task.succeed (Server.withStatus 500 (Server.json (errorJson errId))))` recovers errors to a Response.
- **Sky.Live** (`18-job-queue`, etc.): `Cmd.perform task ResultMsg` dispatches; the `ResultMsg` handler updates a `notification` / `error` field in Model that the `view` renders as a banner. The errId surfaces in the banner so users can quote it in support requests.

**Concurrency:**

`Task.parallel` runs tasks concurrently using Go goroutines. Results are collected in order; the first error short-circuits.

```elm
-- Parallel HTTP requests (total time = slowest request, not sum)
results = Task.perform (Task.parallel [ Http.get url1, Http.get url2, Http.get url3 ])

-- Sequential for comparison (total time = sum of all requests)
results = Task.perform (Task.sequence [ Http.get url1, Http.get url2, Http.get url3 ])
```

`List.parallelMap` maps a function over a list using goroutines (pure, no Task wrapping):

```elm
-- Process items concurrently
squares = List.parallelMap (\n -> n * n) [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ]
-- [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
```

## Go Interop (FFI)

Sky can import any Go package. The compiler auto-generates type-safe
**Result-wrapped** bindings at build time. Every FFI call returns
`Result Error T` because the FFI boundary is a trust boundary —
Go can panic, return nil, or fail in ways Sky's type checker can't
see. The Result wrapping forces explicit handling at every call site
(like Rust's `?`). When in doubt, prefer Sky's stdlib.

```elm
import Net.Http as Http                    -- net/http
import Github.Com.Google.Uuid as Uuid      -- github.com/google/uuid
import Database.Sql as Sql                 -- database/sql
import Drivers.Sqlite as _ exposing (..)   -- side-effect import (Go driver)
import Sky.Core.Result as Result
import Sky.Core.Error as Error
import Std.Log exposing (println)


-- Typical pattern: case-match every FFI call
example =
    case Uuid.newString of
        Ok id ->
            println id

        Err e ->
            println ("uuid failed: " ++ Error.toString e)
```

### Naming Convention

| Go | Sky | Pattern |
|----|-----|---------|
| `uuid.NewString()` | `Uuid.newString ()` | Package function |
| `router.HandleFunc(p, h)` | `Mux.routerHandleFunc router p h` | Method: `{Type}{Method}` |
| `db.Query(q, args...)` | `Sql.dbQuery db q args` | Method on `*sql.DB` |
| `req.URL` (field) | `Http.requestUrl req` | Field: `{Type}{Field}` |
| `http.StatusOK` (const) | `Http.statusOK ()` | Constant: zero-arg function |

### Return Type Mapping

Every FFI call returns `Result Error T`. The Ok side's shape depends
on what Go returns:

| Go Return | Sky Return |
|-----------|------------|
| `T` (single, no error) | `Result Error T` |
| `*T` (single pointer, no error) | `Result Error T` (opaque; nil-deref → Err via recover) |
| `(T, error)` | `Result Error T` |
| `(T, *NamedErr)` where NamedErr implements error | `Result Error T` |
| `(T1, T2, error)` | `Result Error (Tuple2 T1 T2)` |
| `error` | `Result Error Unit` |
| `(T, bool)` (comma-ok) | `Result Error (Maybe T)` |
| `*sql.DB` | `Result Error Db` (opaque handle) |
| `[]string` | `Result Error (List String)` |
| `map[string]int` | `Result Error (Dict String Int)` |
| void | `Result Error Unit` |

For `(T, bool)` comma-ok returns you handle two layers: the Result
captures boundary failure (panic, type mismatch); the Maybe captures
Go's "nothing here" signal (comma-ok false).

Bare `*T` returns aren't auto-wrapped in `Maybe` — many Go SDKs
chain pointer returns through builders/getters and wrapping every
hop in `Maybe` would break the chain. Genuine "may be nil" is
expressed via `(T, error)` or `(T, bool)` in idiomatic Go.

Method calls on a nil opaque return `Err(ErrFfi "nil receiver: ...")`
instead of panicking — every method/getter/setter wrapper has a
nil-receiver guard.

### Opaque Structs (Builder Pattern)

All Go structs are opaque types in Sky. Use constructors + pipeline setters:

```elm
-- Constructor: Pkg.newTypeName ()
-- Getter:     Pkg.typeNameFieldName receiver
-- Setter:     Pkg.typeNameSetFieldName value receiver  (pipeline-friendly)

-- Example: build a Stripe checkout session
-- Each setter returns Result Error TypeName, so chain via Result.andThen.
result =
    Stripe.newCheckoutSessionParams ()
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetMode "payment")
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetSuccessURL url)
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetCustomer customerId)
        |> Result.andThen Session.new
```

Pointer fields (`*string`, `*int64`, `*bool`) are handled automatically — pass the plain value.

### Error Handling — `Sky.Core.Error` (v0.9+ canonical)

Since v0.9 every fallible operation uses `Sky.Core.Error`, a structured
ADT with eleven kinds. No more `Result String` or `Task String` in
public APIs.

```elm
import Sky.Core.Error as Error exposing (Error(..), ErrorKind(..))

-- Type: Error ErrorKind ErrorInfo
-- ErrorKind: Io | Network | Ffi | Decode | Timeout | NotFound
--         | PermissionDenied | InvalidInput | Conflict | Unavailable | Unexpected

-- Constructors:
Error.io : String -> Error
Error.network : String -> Error
Error.ffi : String -> Error
Error.decode : String -> Error
Error.timeout : String -> Error
Error.notFound : Error
Error.permissionDenied : Error
Error.invalidInput : String -> Error
Error.conflict : String -> Error
Error.unavailable : String -> Error
Error.unexpected : String -> Error

-- Builders:
Error.withMessage : String -> Error -> Error
Error.withDetails : ErrorDetails -> Error -> Error
Error.toString : Error -> String
Error.isRetryable : Error -> Bool
```

**Standard library kernels return Error directly**:

```elm
-- Db.exec : Db -> String -> List any -> Result Error Int
-- Http.get : String -> Task Error Response
-- File.readFile : String -> Task Error String

-- In your Lib wrappers, pass the error through — DO NOT re-wrap:
exec queryStr args =
    case Db.exec dbConn queryStr args of
        Ok _ ->
            Ok ()
        Err e ->
            Err e    -- already a Sky.Core.Error
```

**In `update` handlers**: pattern-match on kind. Log AND set UI state:

```elm
handleSignIn model =
    case Auth.authenticateUser model.email model.password of
        Ok user ->
            ( { model | currentUser = Just user, page = Home }, Cmd.none )

        Err (Error kind info) ->
            let
                _ = println ("[AUTH ERROR] " ++ info.message)
                msg =
                    case kind of
                        PermissionDenied -> info.message
                        InvalidInput -> info.message
                        _ -> "Service unavailable"
            in
                ( { model | error = msg }, Cmd.none )
```

## Standard Library — Complete API

> User-facing reference (with examples and explanations) lives in the upstream project at [github.com/anzellai/sky/blob/main/docs/stdlib.md](https://github.com/anzellai/sky/blob/main/docs/stdlib.md). The tables below are the dense AI-targeted version — same surface, no narrative.

### Sky.Core.Prelude (auto-imported)

```elm
-- Types
type Result err ok = Ok ok | Err err
type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing    -- (defined in Sky.Core.Maybe)

-- Functions
identity : a -> a
always : a -> b -> a
fst : (a, b) -> a
snd : (a, b) -> b
clamp : comparable -> comparable -> comparable -> comparable
modBy : Int -> Int -> Int
errorToString : a -> String        -- converts Go error to String
```

### Sky.Core.Maybe

```elm
type Maybe a = Just a | Nothing

withDefault : a -> Maybe a -> a
map : (a -> b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
map2 : (a -> b -> c) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b -> Maybe c
map3 : (a -> b -> c -> d) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b -> Maybe c -> Maybe d
andThen : (a -> Maybe b) -> Maybe a -> Maybe b
```

### Sky.Core.Result

```elm
map : (a -> b) -> Result e a -> Result e b
andThen : (a -> Result e b) -> Result e a -> Result e b
withDefault : a -> Result e a -> a
fromMaybe : e -> Maybe a -> Result e a
mapError : (e -> f) -> Result e a -> Result f a

-- Applicative combinators (v0.7.25+)
map2 : (a -> b -> c) -> Result e a -> Result e b -> Result e c
map3 : (a -> b -> c -> d) -> Result e a -> Result e b -> Result e c -> Result e d
map4 : (a -> b -> c -> d -> f) -> Result e a -> Result e b -> Result e c -> Result e d -> Result e f
map5 : (a -> b -> c -> d -> f -> g) -> Result e a -> Result e b -> Result e c -> Result e d -> Result e f -> Result e g
andMap : Result e a -> Result e (a -> b) -> Result e b      -- pipeline-style for arity > 5
combine : List (Result e a) -> Result e (List a)             -- collect a homogeneous list
traverse : (a -> Result e b) -> List a -> Result e (List b)  -- map then combine
```

**When to use which:**
- `map2..5` — combine N **independent** Results of **different types** into a record. Each parser fails-fast with the first Err. Perfect for form validation, JSON-style record building.
- `andMap` — same idea but pipeline-style; use for arity > 5 fields. `Ok make |> andMap a |> andMap b |> ...`
- `combine` — collect a **homogeneous list** of Results. `[Ok 1, Ok 2, Ok 3]` → `Ok [1, 2, 3]`. First Err short-circuits.
- `traverse` — `combine << List.map f`. Map a fallible function over a list.
- `andThen` — for **dependent** computations where each step needs the previous result. Sequential by nature.

### Auto record constructors (v0.7.26+)

Every record type alias **automatically generates a constructor function** with the same name. Field declaration order in the type alias is the positional argument order of the constructor.

```elm
type alias Profile =
    { name : String
    , age : Int
    , active : Bool
    }

-- Sky auto-generates:
--   Profile : String -> Int -> Bool -> Profile
--   Profile name age active = { name = name, age = age, active = active }

-- Use it directly:
alice = Profile "Alice" 30 True

-- Or with applicative combinators (no makeProfile helper needed):
result =
    Result.map3 Profile
        (parseString "name" formData.name)
        (parseInt "age" formData.age)
        (parseBool "active" formData.active)
```

This matches Elm's behaviour for the same construct. Notes:

- Only **record** type aliases generate constructors. Aliases like `type alias Name = String` don't.
- If you define a function with the same name as the type alias, **your definition wins** — Sky skips the auto-generation. This lets you provide a custom constructor with validation, defaults, etc.
- Adding a field in the middle of a type alias is a **breaking change** for any code that uses the constructor positionally — same trade-off the wider ML-family / Elm tradition makes.
- Constructors are exported from a module the same way the type alias is. `module Foo exposing (Profile)` exposes both the type and the constructor.

### Sky.Core.List

```elm
map : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b
filter : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> List a
foldl : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
foldr : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> List a -> b
head : List a -> Maybe a
tail : List a -> Maybe (List a)
length : List a -> Int
append : List a -> List a -> List a
reverse : List a -> List a
member : a -> List a -> Bool
range : Int -> Int -> List Int            -- inclusive range
isEmpty : List a -> Bool
take : Int -> List a -> List a
drop : Int -> List a -> List a
sort : List comparable -> List comparable
intersperse : a -> List a -> List a
concat : List (List a) -> List a
concatMap : (a -> List b) -> List a -> List b
indexedMap : (Int -> a -> b) -> List a -> List b
singleton : a -> List a
all : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> Bool
any : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> Bool
sum : List Int -> Int
product : List Int -> Int
maximum : List comparable -> Maybe comparable
minimum : List comparable -> Maybe comparable
partition : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> (List a, List a)
find : (a -> Bool) -> List a -> Maybe a
filterMap : (a -> Maybe b) -> List a -> List b
sortBy : (a -> comparable) -> List a -> List a
zip : List a -> List b -> List (a, b)
unzip : List (a, b) -> (List a, List b)
map2 : (a -> b -> c) -> List a -> List b -> List c
parallelMap : (a -> b) -> List a -> List b  -- goroutine-backed concurrent map
```

### Sky.Core.String

```elm
fromInt : Int -> String
fromFloat : Float -> String

### Sky.Core.Char

Unicode-aware character classification (backed by Go's `unicode` package):

```elm
isUpper : Char -> Bool      -- unicode.IsUpper (supports accented chars)
isLower : Char -> Bool      -- unicode.IsLower
isAlpha : Char -> Bool      -- unicode.IsLetter (all Unicode letters)

isAlphaNum : Char -> Bool   -- IsLetter || IsDigit
toUpper : Char -> Char
toLower : Char -> Char
toCode : Char -> Int
fromCode : Int -> Char
```

### Sky.Core.Tuple

```elm
first : (a, b) -> a
second : (a, b) -> b
mapFirst : (a -> c) -> (a, b) -> (c, b)
mapSecond : (b -> c) -> (a, b) -> (a, c)
mapBoth : (a -> c) -> (b -> d) -> (a, b) -> (c, d)
pair : a -> b -> (a, b)
```

shiftRightBy : Int -> Int -> Int
shiftRightZfBy : Int -> Int -> Int
```

### Sky.Core.Set

```elm
empty : Set a
singleton : a -> Set a
insert : a -> Set a -> Set a
remove : a -> Set a -> Set a
member : a -> Set a -> Bool
size : Set a -> Int
isEmpty : Set a -> Bool

map : (a -> b) -> Set a -> Set b
filter : (a -> Bool) -> Set a -> Set a
foldl : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> Set a -> b
```

### Sky.Core.Array

```elm
empty : Array a
fromList : List a -> Array a
toList : Array a -> List a
get : Int -> Array a -> Maybe a
set : Int -> a -> Array a -> Array a
push : a -> Array a -> Array a

foldr : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> Array a -> b
append : Array a -> Array a -> Array a
indexedMap : (Int -> a -> b) -> Array a -> Array b
```

### Sky.Core.File

All fallible IO lives in `Task`. Execute with `Task.run` for a synchronous
`Result Error a`, or pass through `Cmd.perform` in a Sky.Live app.

```elm
readFile : String -> Task Error String
readFileLimit : String -> Int -> Task Error String       -- bounded read (default 100 MiB)
readFileBytes : String -> Task Error Bytes               -- binary
writeFile : String -> String -> Task Error ()
append : String -> String -> Task Error ()               -- creates if missing
exists : String -> Task Error Bool
isDir : String -> Task Error Bool
remove : String -> Task Error ()
mkdirAll : String -> Task Error ()
readDir : String -> Task Error (List String)
tempFile : String -> Task Error String                   -- returns path
tempDir : String -> Task Error String                    -- creates uniquely-named dir, returns path
copy : String -> String -> Task Error ()
rename : String -> String -> Task Error ()
```

Usage:
```elm
loadConfig : Task Error Config
loadConfig =
    File.readFile "config.toml"
        |> Task.andThen parseConfig

-- Synchronous extraction (at a main-ish boundary, or when you know
-- you can block):
main =
    case Task.run loadConfig of
        Ok config -> runApp config
        Err e -> println ("Failed to load config: " ++ Error.toString e)
```

### Sky.Core.System

The single OS-interaction kernel (v0.10.0+ — replaces `Os`, `Args`,
`Std.Env`, and the env/exit/cwd half of `Process`). All Task-wrapped
per the Task-everywhere doctrine; `let _ = …` discards auto-force.

```elm
args        : ()  -> Task Error (List String)         -- os.Args[1:] minus program name
getArg      : Int -> Task Error (Maybe String)        -- nth element of os.Args (0-indexed)
getenv      : String -> Task Error String             -- Err if unset
getenvOr    : String -> String -> String              -- env var or default; never errs (bare String)
getenvInt   : String -> Task Error Int                -- typed; Err on missing or unparseable
getenvBool  : String -> Task Error Bool               -- accepts true/yes/1/on or false/no/0/off
cwd         : ()  -> Task Error String                -- current working directory
exit        : Int -> a                                -- diverging — process terminates
loadEnv     : ()  -> Task Error ()                    -- load .env from cwd into the process env
setenv      : String -> String -> Task Error ()       -- write a process env var
unsetenv    : String -> Task Error ()                 -- remove a process env var (idempotent)
```

Production deployments override env via the process environment (Docker
`ENV`, k8s, CI vars). `loadEnv ()` is for local dev — never overrides
existing vars.

**Env-var namespace prefix (v0.11.5+).** The runtime reads its own
config (Sky.Live, Std.Auth, Std.Log, Std.Db) under the `SKY_` prefix
by default — `SKY_LIVE_PORT`, `SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`, `SKY_LOG_FORMAT`,
etc. Projects that share a host with other Sky binaries can declare a
custom prefix in `sky.toml` to keep their config private:

```toml
[env]
prefix = "FENCE"
```

The runtime then reads `FENCE_LIVE_PORT`, `FENCE_AUTH_TOKEN_TTL`, etc.
User code calling `System.getenv "DATABASE_URL"` reads the raw name
unchanged — only Sky's internal namespace is prefixed.

`System.setenv` / `System.unsetenv` cover the write side without Go
FFI for the rare case where the value isn't known until runtime
(derived from a startup flag, computed from another secret, etc.).

### Sky.Core.Process

```elm
run : String -> List String -> Task Error String      -- subprocess: combined stdout+stderr
```

That's the whole module. `exit` / `getEnv` / `getCwd` / `loadEnv`
moved to `System.*` in v0.10.0 — there's no longer a `Process.exit`.

### Sky.Core.Debug

```elm
log : String -> a -> a          -- prints tag + value, returns value unchanged
toString : a -> String          -- convert any value to string representation
```

### Sky.Core.Json.Encode

```elm
encode : Int -> Value -> String       -- serialise with indentation
string : String -> Value
int : Int -> Value
float : Float -> Value
bool : Bool -> Value
null : Value
list : (a -> Value) -> List a -> Value
object : List (String, Value) -> Value
```

### Sky.Core.Json.Decode

```elm
decodeString : Decoder a -> String -> Result Error a
decodeValue : Decoder a -> Value -> Result Error a
string : Decoder String
int : Decoder Int
float : Decoder Float
bool : Decoder Bool
null : a -> Decoder a
nullable : Decoder a -> Decoder (Maybe a)
value : Decoder Value
list : Decoder a -> Decoder (List a)
dict : Decoder a -> Decoder (Dict String a)
field : String -> Decoder a -> Decoder a
at : List String -> Decoder a -> Decoder a
index : Int -> Decoder a -> Decoder a
map : (a -> b) -> Decoder a -> Decoder b
map2 : (a -> b -> c) -> Decoder a -> Decoder b -> Decoder c
map3 .. map8 : combine up to 8 decoders
succeed : a -> Decoder a
fail : String -> Decoder a
andThen : (a -> Decoder b) -> Decoder a -> Decoder b
oneOf : List (Decoder a) -> Decoder a
maybe : Decoder a -> Decoder (Maybe a)
lazy : (() -> Decoder a) -> Decoder a
```

### Sky.Core.Json.Decode.Pipeline

```elm
-- Usage: Decode.succeed MyType |> required "field" Decode.string |> required "age" Decode.int
required : String -> Decoder a -> Decoder (a -> b) -> Decoder b
requiredAt : List String -> Decoder a -> Decoder (a -> b) -> Decoder b
optional : String -> Decoder a -> a -> Decoder (a -> b) -> Decoder b
optionalAt : List String -> Decoder a -> a -> Decoder (a -> b) -> Decoder b
hardcoded : a -> Decoder (a -> b) -> Decoder b
custom : Decoder a -> Decoder (a -> b) -> Decoder b
```

### Std.Log

The single logging surface (v0.10.0+ — absorbed `Slog`).

```elm
println : String -> Task Error ()
debug   : String -> Task Error ()
info    : String -> Task Error ()
warn    : String -> Task Error ()
error   : String -> Task Error ()

-- structured variants — second arg is `[ "k1", "v1", "k2", "v2", … ]`
debugWith : String -> List a -> Task Error ()
infoWith  : String -> List a -> Task Error ()
warnWith  : String -> List a -> Task Error ()
errorWith : String -> List a -> Task Error ()
```

Configure at runtime via env vars (or sky.toml `[log]` defaults):
- `SKY_LOG_FORMAT` = `plain` (default) | `json`
- `SKY_LOG_LEVEL`  = `debug` | `info` (default) | `warn` | `error`

### Std.Cmd

```elm
type Cmd msg = Cmd Foreign

none           : Cmd msg
perform        : Task err a -> (Result err a -> msg) -> Cmd msg
batch          : List (Cmd msg) -> Cmd msg
publish        : String -> any -> Cmd msg   -- pub/sub broadcast, echo-by-default (Sky.Live only)
publishNoEcho  : String -> any -> Cmd msg   -- pub/sub broadcast, broker skips publisher's own subscription
```

`Cmd.perform` runs a Task in a background goroutine. When it completes, the result is dispatched as a Msg through the full update/view/diff/SSE cycle:

```elm
type Msg = FetchData | DataLoaded (Result Error String)

update msg model =
    case msg of
        FetchData ->
            ( { model | loading = True }
            , Cmd.perform (Http.get "/api/data") DataLoaded
            )
        DataLoaded result ->
            ( { model | loading = False, data = Result.withDefault "" result }
            , Cmd.none
            )
```

Use `Cmd.batch` to run multiple commands concurrently:
```elm
Cmd.batch
    [ Cmd.perform task1 Msg1
    , Cmd.perform task2 Msg2
    ]
```

### Std.Sub

```elm
type Sub msg = SubNone | SubTimer Int msg | SubBatch (List (Sub msg)) | SubSubscribeTopic String (any -> msg)

none           : Sub msg
batch          : List (Sub msg) -> Sub msg
every          : Int -> msg -> Sub msg                 -- timer; fires msg every N ms
subscribeTopic : String -> (any -> msg) -> Sub msg     -- pub/sub receive (Sky.Live only)
```

### Std.PubSub

Task-shaped publish for ANY context (raw `Sky.Http.Server` `api` handlers, post-init goroutines, scheduled jobs, webhook callbacks). Complements `Cmd.publish` which only fires from a Sky.Live `update` return — same broker, same subscribers, same in-process semantics.

```elm
publish        : String -> any -> Task Error Int  -- delivery count; Err Unavailable if no Live.app
publishNoEcho  : String -> any -> Task Error Int  -- sets broker's SkipOrigin bit (forward-compat with v0.16+ cross-process tiers)
```

Both `Cmd.publish` and `Std.PubSub.publish` route to the same in-process topic registry — a subscriber's `Sub.subscribeTopic` receives them identically. Use `Cmd.publish` when you're inside an update return; use `Std.PubSub.publish` (with `Task.run` or `Cmd.perform`) from anywhere else.

`publishNoEcho` is the "instant feedback for publisher" variant — the broker skips delivery to subscribers whose ownSid matches the publisher's sid (the publisher updates its own model directly in `update`, and only OTHER sessions receive the broadcast). Saves one broker round-trip per publish; in v0.16+ cross-process broker tiers that's 10-100ms+ of network latency.

### Std.Time

```elm
every : Int -> msg -> Sub msg    -- timer subscription, fires msg every N milliseconds
```

### Pub/sub (`Cmd.publish` + `Sub.subscribeTopic`)

Server-side broadcast channel between Sky.Live sessions. Use to push
real-time updates WITHOUT polling — chatrooms, collaborative editors,
live dashboards, presence indicators.

**Decision rule.** **DB writes in your own Sky.Live app → pub/sub.**
**External state changing on another service → `Time.every` poll.**

| Use case | Primitive |
|---|---|
| Chat / collab / multi-session UI | `Cmd.publish` + `Sub.subscribeTopic` |
| Animation tick, clock, watchdog heartbeat | `Sub.every` / `Time.every` |
| Periodic refresh of state from an external HTTP API that doesn't push | `Time.every` + `Cmd.perform` |

**Mandatory pattern: persist FIRST, publish SECOND.** Notification
loss is acceptable (process crash, network blip); data loss is not.
The DB row is the source of truth; the broadcast is the low-latency
hint. Late joiners load history from the DB; in-flight subscribers
hear the broadcast.

```elm
type Msg
    = SendChat String
    | ChatReceived any        -- any payload — decoder turns it into your Msg shape
    | PersistOk (Result Error Int)


subscriptions model =
    case model.page of
        ChatPage room ->
            Sub.subscribeTopic ("chat:room-" ++ room) ChatReceived

        _ ->
            Sub.none


update msg model =
    case msg of
        SendChat text ->
            let
                chatMsg = { author = model.me, text = text, at = nowString () }
                payload =
                    Dict.fromList
                        [ ( "author", chatMsg.author )
                        , ( "text", chatMsg.text )
                        , ( "at", chatMsg.at )
                        ]
            in
                ( model
                , Cmd.batch
                    [ Cmd.perform (persistChatMessage chatMsg) PersistOk    -- 1. DB write
                    , Cmd.publish ("chat:room-" ++ model.room) payload      -- 2. broadcast
                    ]
                )

        ChatReceived payload ->
            let
                chatMsg =
                    { author = Db.getString "author" payload
                    , text   = Db.getString "text"   payload
                    , at     = Db.getString "at"     payload
                    }
            in
                ( { model | history = List.append model.history [chatMsg] }
                , Cmd.none
                )
```

**Echo-by-default.** The publisher's OWN subscription ALSO receives
the broadcast (matches Redis / NATS / MQTT). Apps can self-skip on
origin via the broadcast's `Origin` field if needed.

**Topics are exact-match strings.** Build per-room / per-user topics
by concatenation: `"chat:room-" ++ roomId`, `"presence:" ++ userId`.

**Sub.batch composes everything.** A single session can subscribe to
multiple topics AND a `Sub.every` tick simultaneously — the runtime
diff-updates subscriptions on every dispatch, so topics in the
intersection of old + new sets keep their existing goroutine + broker
registration (no broadcast loss in the gap).

**v0.15.x is in-process only.** A single Sky.Live instance. v0.16+
plugs in cross-process broker tiers (Redis, Cloud Pub/Sub, NATS,
Postgres LISTEN/NOTIFY) via the existing `liveStore.Subscribe`
interface without app-source changes — pick the broker in `sky.toml`
`[live.broker]`. See `docs/skylive/pubsub.md` for the user-facing
tutorial and `docs/skylive/pubsub-design.md` for the architecture
write-up. The worked example is `examples/27-multi-session-chat`.

### Sky.Core.Time

```elm
sleep : Int -> Task Error ()    -- sleep for N milliseconds (use with Cmd.perform for async delays)
now : () -> Task Error Int      -- current Unix time in milliseconds
```

### Sky.Core.Random

```elm
int : Int -> Int -> Task Error Int       -- random int in [lo, hi] range
float : Float -> Float -> Task Error Float
choice : List a -> Task Error a          -- random element from list
shuffle : List a -> Task Error (List a)  -- Fisher-Yates shuffle
```

### Std.Decimal — arbitrary-precision arithmetic

For money, billing, tax, invoices — anything where 0.1 + 0.2 must equal
0.3 exactly. Backed by shopspring/decimal under the hood. `Decimal` is
opaque; construct via `fromString` / `fromInt` / `fromFloat` / `fromMinor`.

```elm
import Std.Decimal as Dec exposing (Decimal)

-- Construction
fromString : String -> Result Error Decimal      -- "3.14" → Decimal
fromInt    : Int -> Decimal
fromFloat  : Float -> Decimal
fromMinor  : Int -> Int -> Decimal               -- fromMinor 2 12345 = 123.45

-- Arithmetic (exact)
add, sub, mul : Decimal -> Decimal -> Decimal
div, mod      : Decimal -> Decimal -> Result Error Decimal  -- Err on /0
neg, abs      : Decimal -> Decimal

-- Rounding modes
round       : Int -> Decimal -> Decimal    -- banker's (round-half-to-even)
roundHalfUp : Int -> Decimal -> Decimal    -- schools rounding
truncate    : Int -> Decimal -> Decimal    -- toward zero
floor, ceil : Decimal -> Decimal

-- Comparison
compare : Decimal -> Decimal -> Int   -- -1 / 0 / 1
eq, neq, lt, lte, gt, gte : Decimal -> Decimal -> Bool
min, max : Decimal -> Decimal -> Decimal
isZero, isPositive, isNegative : Decimal -> Bool

-- Percent
percentOf   : Decimal -> Decimal -> Decimal   -- percentOf 20 100 = 20
addPercent  : Decimal -> Decimal -> Decimal   -- addPercent 10 100 = 110
subPercent  : Decimal -> Decimal -> Decimal   -- subPercent 10 100 = 90

-- Formatting
toString      : Decimal -> String
toStringFixed : Int -> Decimal -> String       -- always N dp
formatWith    : String -> String -> Int -> Decimal -> String
                                               -- thousandsSep decimalSep places d
                                               -- formatWith "," "." 2 → "1,234,567.89" (US)
                                               -- formatWith "." "," 2 → "1.234.567,89" (EU)

sum  : List Decimal -> Decimal
zero, one, oneHundred : Decimal
```

### Std.Money — currency-aware arithmetic on Decimal

ISO 4217 minor-unit awareness (JPY=0dp, USD=2dp, BHD=3dp).
Currency-match enforced at add/sub. Built-in fair-split allocator.
Pluggable FX rate registry.

```elm
import Std.Money as Money exposing (Money, Currency(..))
import Std.Decimal as Dec

-- Currency: 50+ codes (USD/EUR/GBP/JPY/CNY/…/BTC/ETH/USDT) + CurrencyRaw String

-- Construction
Money.fromMajor USD 100       -- $100.00
Money.fromMinor USD 12345     -- $123.45 (cents)
Money.fromString USD "99.99"  -- Result Error Money

-- Accessors
Money.amount, Money.currency, Money.currencyCode

-- Currency metadata (ISO 4217)
Money.minorUnits   : Currency -> Int     -- USD=2, JPY=0, BHD=3
Money.symbol       : Currency -> String  -- "$", "¥", "£", …
Money.currencyName : Currency -> String
Money.knownCurrency : Currency -> Bool  -- False only for CurrencyRaw _
Money.isKnownCode   : String   -> Bool  -- raw ISO-code predicate (form input)
Money.parseCurrency : String   -> Currency

-- Arithmetic — currency-checked
Money.add, Money.sub : Money -> Money -> Money      -- same-currency or no-op
Money.mul            : Decimal -> Money -> Money    -- scalar multiply
Money.neg, Money.abs

-- Fair-split: sum-preserving allocation
Money.allocate 3 ($100)   -- [$33.34, $33.33, $33.33] — sums to $100 exactly
Money.sumOf USD [..]

-- Comparison, predicates
Money.eq/neq/lt/lte/gt/gte, Money.compare
Money.isZero, Money.isPositive, Money.isNegative

-- Percent (returns same currency)
Money.percentOf, Money.addPercent, Money.subPercent

-- Formatting
Money.format          -- "$12.34" — symbol-prefix
Money.formatWithCode  -- "12.34 USD" — ISO suffix (B2B)
Money.toMinor         -- → integer cents (for DB persistence)

-- FX rate registry (process-local)
Money.setRate USD EUR (Dec.fromString "0.92" |> okOrZero)   -- inverse auto-set
Money.getRate, Money.hasRate, Money.clearRates
Money.convert EUR ($100 USD)   -- Result Error Money
```

### Std.Time — IANA timezone-aware helpers

Complements kernel `Sky.Core.Time` (UTC-only). Zone strings are IANA
("UTC", "America/New_York", "Asia/Tokyo"). Embedded `time/tzdata` so
calls work in container/scratch images without /usr/share/zoneinfo.

```elm
import Std.Time as Tz

-- Formatting (Go layout strings)
Tz.inZone : String -> Int -> Result Error String       -- RFC 3339 with offset
Tz.formatInZone "America/New_York" "2006-01-02 15:04" ms

-- Calendar arithmetic (CLAMPED — Jan 31 + 1 month = Feb 28/29, NOT Mar 3)
Tz.addMonths, Tz.addYears : Int -> Int -> Int
Tz.addDays, Tz.addHours, Tz.addMinutes, Tz.addSeconds : Int -> Int -> Int

-- Period boundaries (zone-aware — local midnight, not UTC midnight)
Tz.startOfDay, Tz.endOfDay
Tz.startOfWeek                -- Monday (ISO 8601)
Tz.startOfMonth, Tz.endOfMonth
Tz.startOfYear, Tz.endOfYear

-- Calendar queries
Tz.year, Tz.month, Tz.day      : String -> Int -> Result Error Int
Tz.dayOfWeek                   -- ISO: Monday=1 .. Sunday=7
Tz.dayOfYear, Tz.weekOfYear    -- ISO 8601 week
Tz.isWeekend
Tz.daysInMonth y m             -- pure (no zone)
Tz.isLeapYear

-- Differences (a - b)
Tz.diffDays, Tz.diffHours, Tz.diffMinutes, Tz.diffSeconds : Int -> Int -> Int

-- Construction from parts
Tz.fromParts zone y m d h min s : Result Error Int

-- Zone discovery
Tz.zoneOffset, Tz.zoneName     -- DST-aware for the given moment
Tz.utc                          -- shorthand "UTC"

-- v0.15.48+ infallible UTC companions

### Sky.Core.ToString — uniform naming surface (v0.15.48+)

When you need "convert this thing to a String" without remembering
which kernel namespace it lives under, reach for `Sky.Core.ToString`.
Routes to existing kernels — zero runtime overhead vs the canonical
form.

```elm
import Sky.Core.ToString as ToString

ToString.fromInt 42        -- "42"   (→ String.fromInt)
ToString.fromFloat 3.14    -- "3.14" (→ String.fromFloat)
ToString.fromBool True     -- "True"
ToString.fromTime ms       -- canonical timeString (→ Time.timeString)
```

The canonical sub-namespace functions stay (`String.fromInt`,
`Time.timeString`) — `Sky.Core.ToString` is purely a discoverability
surface for editors and `sky doc`.

### Sky.Core.Pure — uniform `() -> Task Error a` arity-0 mirror (v0.15.50+)

Long-standing wart: some arity-0 stdlib bindings take `()`
(`Time.now ()`), others are bare (`Uuid.v4`). For new code preferring
a single consistent `Pure.foo ()` shape across every entropy / clock
/ env / I/O surface, import `Sky.Core.Pure as Pure` — every wrapper
is a typed `() -> Task Error a` tail-call alias to the canonical
kernel:

```elm
import Sky.Core.Pure as Pure
import Sky.Core.Task as Task

main =
    Pure.systemCwd ()                                  -- () -> Task Error String
        |> Task.andThen (\cwd  -> Pure.uuidV4 ())      -- () -> Task Error String
        |> Task.andThen (\uuid -> Pure.timeNow ())     -- () -> Task Error Int
        |> Task.andThen (\now  -> println (String.fromInt now))
```

Current Pure.* surface (9 entries):

```
Pure.uuidV4          : () -> Task Error String
Pure.uuidV7          : () -> Task Error String
Pure.timeNow         : () -> Task Error Int
Pure.timeUnixMillis  : () -> Task Error Int
Pure.systemArgs      : () -> Task Error (List String)
Pure.systemCwd       : () -> Task Error String
Pure.systemLoadEnv   : () -> Task Error ()
Pure.ioReadLine      : () -> Task Error String
Pure.dbConnect       : () -> Task Error Db
```

Inclusion criterion: a binding belongs to `Sky.Core.Pure` when it
takes no real Sky-level argument that disambiguates the call AND
returns a `Task Error a`. Non-zero-arg helpers like `Random.int` /
`Crypto.randomToken` / `System.exit` / `Process.run` are NOT
candidates — their argument list carries semantic information.

Existing names + shapes unchanged: `Time.now ()` / `Uuid.v4` /
`System.cwd ()` / `Db.connect ()` etc. still work exactly as before.
`Pure.*` is purely additive — pick whichever surface fits the style
of your codebase.

### Std.Auth — JWT typed-builder (v0.15.48+)

Two equivalent paths for signing JWTs. The arity-3 short form stays
canonical for the simple case; the *WithClaims variant gives full
control over the `Sky.Core.Jwt.Algorithm` + `Jwt.Claims` builders:

```elm
import Std.Auth as Auth
import Sky.Core.Jwt as Jwt
import Sky.Core.Time as Time

-- Simple case
short = Auth.signToken "secret" claimsRecord 86400

-- Typed-builder case (RS256, multi-claim, custom audience, jti)
typed =
    Auth.signTokenWithClaims
        (Jwt.rs256 privateKeyPem)
        (Jwt.claims
            |> Jwt.subject "user-42"
            |> Jwt.audience "https://api.example.app"
            |> Jwt.expiresAt (now + 86400)
            |> Jwt.jwtId tokenId
            |> Jwt.withClaim "scope" "admin"
        )

-- Verify with explicit algorithm + window-check time
case Auth.verifyTokenWithAlgorithm (Jwt.hs256 "secret") now token of
    Ok rawJson -> ...
    Err e      -> ...
```

### Std.Html

v0.13: `Std.Html` / `Std.Html.Attributes` / `Std.Html.Events` are
**typed Sky-source stdlib modules**, not Go kernels. Element builders
return a typed `Html msg` ADT (not the old `VNode`). The compiler +
LSP flag a handler-shape or attribute-type mismatch at the call site.

```elm
type Html msg
    = HElement String (List (Attribute msg)) (List (Html msg))
    | HText String
    | HRaw String

text : String -> Html msg                 -- escaped text node
raw  : String -> Html msg                  -- raw, un-escaped HTML (trusted)
render : Html msg -> String                -- Html → HTML string (SSR)
toString : Html msg -> String              -- alias for render

-- Sectioning: div, section, article, aside, headerNode, footerNode,
--   nav, mainNode  | Headings: h1..h6
-- Text: p, span, strong, em, small, pre, codeNode, blockquote, a
-- Lists: ul, ol, li  | Forms: form, label, button, textarea, select,
--   option, fieldset, legend  | Tables: table, thead, tbody, tfoot,
--   tr, th, td  | Document: htmlNode, headNode, body, doctype, titleNode
-- Void (attrs only, no children): input, br, hr, img, meta, link
-- Special: script, styleNode
```

Element builders: `List (Attribute msg) -> List (Html msg) -> Html msg`.
Void elements: `List (Attribute msg) -> Html msg`.
`styleNode : List (Attribute msg) -> String -> Html msg` (CSS body is
a String). `doctype : List (Html msg) -> Html msg` (wraps the document
— `render (doctype [ htmlNode [] [...] ])`).

**Naming**: clashing HTML5 elements use suffixed names — `headerNode`,
`footerNode`, `mainNode`, `codeNode`, `styleNode`, `titleNode`. For an
inline `<script>` body, pass `[raw "...js..."]` (raw, un-escaped).

### Std.Html.Attributes

Each builder returns a typed `Attribute msg` — the compiler rejects
`disabled "yes"` / `rows "five"` at the call site.

```elm
type Attribute msg
    = Attr String String
    | BoolAttr String Bool
    | EventAttr (Event msg)
    | NoAttr

-- String-valued: class, id, type_ (NOT `type`), value, href, src, alt,
--   name, placeholder, title, for, rel, target, method, action, role,
--   style, charset, content, httpEquiv, pattern, accept, autocomplete,
--   ariaLabel, ariaHidden, ariaDescribedby, ariaExpanded, dir, lang, ...
-- Int-valued (genuinely numeric): rows, cols, width, height, size,
--   minlength, maxlength, tabindex, colspan, rowspan
-- String-valued numeric-or-keyword: min, max, step
-- Bool-valued: checked, disabled, readonly, required, autofocus,
--   novalidate, selected, multiple, hidden, spellcheck
-- Escape hatches: attribute k v, dataAttribute k v, boolAttribute k b
-- none : Attribute msg   -- no-op, for the False branch of a conditional
```

### Std.Html.Events  (was `Std.Html.Events` pre-v0.13)

Builders return `Attribute msg` carrying a typed `Event msg`.

```elm
onClick    : msg -> Attribute msg
onInput    : (String -> msg) -> Attribute msg
onChange   : (String -> msg) -> Attribute msg
onSubmit   : a -> Attribute msg         -- plain Msg OR (formData -> Msg)
on         : String -> a -> Attribute msg   -- generic escape hatch
onDblClick / onFocus / onBlur / onMouseOver / onMouseOut / onMouseDown
  / onMouseUp / onContextMenu / onReset / onScroll / onSelect
  / onLoad / onError : msg -> Attribute msg
onKeyDown / onKeyUp / onKeyPress : (String -> msg) -> Attribute msg
onCheck    : (Bool -> msg) -> Attribute msg
onFile / onImage : (String -> msg) -> Attribute msg   -- data-URL payload
fileMaxSize / fileMaxWidth / fileMaxHeight : Int -> Attribute msg

-- Usage:
--     button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
--     input [ onInput UpdateDraft, value model.draft ] []
--     form [ onSubmit AddTodo ] [ ... ]
```

### Std.Css

v0.13: typed Sky-source stdlib. Typed where the value space is bounded
(`Length` / `Color` ADTs, keyword enums), `String` + `rawProp` escape
hatch for the open-ended compound properties.

```elm
type CssProp = CssProp String String
type CssRule = CssRule String (List CssProp) | CssMedia ... | CssKeyframes ... | CssRaw String

-- Length values: px (Int), rem/em/pct/ch/num (Float), vh/vw/fr (Int),
--   zero ()/auto () (take unit), lengthRaw "calc(...)" , calc, minmax
-- Color values: hex "ff6600", rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla, transparent ()/
--   currentColor () (take unit), colorRaw "inherit"
-- Keyword enums: Display (Flex/Grid/Block/InlineBlock/InlineFlex/
--   Inline/DisplayNone/DisplayRaw), Position (Static/Relative/Absolute
--   /Fixed/Sticky), Cursor (Pointer/CursorDefault/...), FlexDirection
--   (Row/Column/...), FlexWrap, Align (Start/End/Center/SpaceBetween/
--   ...), FontWeight (Normal/Bold/Weight Int/...), FontStyle, Overflow,
--   WhiteSpace, BoxSizing, PointerEvents, TextDecoration, BorderStyle

-- Composition
rule : String -> List CssProp -> CssRule        -- selector { props }
media : String -> List CssRule -> CssRule       -- @media query { rules }
keyframes : String -> List String -> CssRule    -- build frames with `frame`
stylesheet : List CssRule -> String             -- render to a <style> body
styles : List CssProp -> String                 -- inline style="..." string
property : String -> String -> CssProp          -- generic escape hatch
rawProp : String -> CssProp                     -- a "name:value" decl string

-- Length-valued props: width, height, maxWidth, minWidth, maxHeight,
--   minHeight, fontSize, lineHeight, letterSpacing, padding(+Top/etc.,
--   padding2, padding4), margin(+Top/etc., margin2, margin4), gap,
--   rowGap, columnGap, borderRadius(4), top, bottom, left, right,
--   flexBasis, borderWidth, borderSpacing, outlineOffset
-- Color-valued: color, background, backgroundColor, borderColor
-- Enum-valued: display, position, cursor, textAlign, fontWeight,
--   fontStyle, flexDirection, flexWrap, justifyContent, alignItems,
--   alignContent, overflow(X/Y), whiteSpace, boxSizing, pointerEvents,
--   textDecoration, borderStyle
-- String-valued (open-ended): transition, transform, animation,
--   boxShadow, gridTemplateColumns/Rows, gridColumn/Row, fontFamily,
--   content, filter, backgroundImage, border(+Top/etc.), flex, clear,
--   float, visibility, objectFit, textTransform, ...
-- Int/Float-valued: zIndex (Int), opacity (Float), flexGrow/Shrink (Int)
```

Example: `rule ".btn" [ display Flex, padding (px 12), color (hex
"fff"), backgroundColor (hex "2563eb"), cursor Pointer, fontWeight
(Weight 600), border "1px solid #ccc" ]`.

### Std.Live

```elm
app : config -> config     -- marks as Sky.Live app (compiler detects this)
route : String -> page -> (String, page)   -- route "/" MyPage (supports :param)
```

**Sensitive inputs (passwords, API keys, card details): collect via `onSubmit` form data, not `onInput` per keystroke.** This is the recommended pattern as of v0.9.8:

```elm
type alias AuthCreds =
    { email : String, password : String }

type Msg
    = UpdateEmail String
    | DoSignIn AuthCreds

view model =
    form [ onSubmit DoSignIn ]
        [ input
            [ type_ "email"
            , name "email"            -- required: name is the formData key
            , value model.email       -- email is fine to round-trip via Model
            , onInput UpdateEmail
            ] []
        , input
            [ type_ "password"
            , name "password"
            -- no `value` attr (don't round-trip the secret through DOM)
            -- no `onInput`     (don't dispatch per keystroke)
            ] []
        , button [ type_ "submit" ] [ text "Sign in" ]
        ]

update msg model =
    case msg of
        UpdateEmail e ->
            ( { model | email = e }, Cmd.none )

        DoSignIn creds ->
            -- creds.email and creds.password come straight from a typed
            -- record decode at the dispatch boundary (v0.9.8+).
            ( model, Cmd.perform (signIn creds) GotAuth )
```

Why:

1. **No password-manager extension churn.** 1Password / Bitwarden / browser autofill watch DOM mutations on password inputs. Every server-driven re-render that includes `value="…"` on the password input looks like the form changed and triggers a re-prompt / re-fill cycle (focus juddering, autofill mid-word, selection lost). With no `value` attr and no `onInput`, the password input's DOM stays untouched between user keystrokes and submit.

2. **Secret never lives in Model.** Without a `UpdateAuthPassword` Msg you can't store the password in your Model, so it's never serialised into the session store (Redis, Postgres, etc.). It exists only in the browser DOM until form submit, then briefly in the `DoSignIn` Msg's record argument until `update` consumes it. Per-keystroke handlers carry a partial password through every store round-trip — avoid them for secrets.

3. **Race-free submit.** Per-keystroke `onInput` debounces (150ms) can drop the last keystroke if the user hits Enter before the debounce settles — the auth attempt then sees the wrong password and the user retries blind. Form submit reads the live DOM value, so whatever's in the input at submit time is what gets sent.

The `DoSignIn AuthCreds` constructor takes a typed record alias — the dispatch boundary in v0.9.8+ JSON-decodes the wire form data directly into `State_AuthCreds_R{Email, Password}` via Go's case-insensitive struct field matching. No runtime guessing, no per-Msg decoder boilerplate. Same pattern works for any sensitive multi-field form (API keys, addresses, card details).

The older `onChange` pattern (fires on blur) is still acceptable when you need the password in Model for validation feedback before submit, but prefer `onSubmit` + typed record for normal sign-in / sign-up flows.

### Std.Ui — typed no-CSS layout DSL (recommended for new view code)

A typed layout DSL. Build a UI from typed primitives (`row`, `column`, `el`) and typed attributes (`Background.color`, `Border.rounded`, `Font.size`, `Region.heading`) — no CSS files. Renders to inline-styled HTML via Std.Html.

```elm
import Std.Ui as Ui
import Std.Ui exposing (Element)
import Std.Ui.Background as Background
import Std.Ui.Border as Border
import Std.Ui.Font as Font

view : Model -> any
view model =
    Ui.layout []
        (Ui.row
            [ Ui.spacing 12, Ui.padding 16
            , Background.color (Ui.rgb 255 102 0)
            , Font.color (Ui.rgb 255 255 255)
            , Border.rounded 4
            ]
            [ Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Decrement, label = Ui.text "−" }
            , Ui.el [ Font.size 24, Font.bold ] (Ui.text (String.fromInt model.count))
            , Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Increment, label = Ui.text "+" }
            ])
```

**Surface (full reference: `docs/skyui/overview.md`):**

| Area | Helpers |
|---|---|
| Layout | `el / row / column / wrappedRow (children wrap to next line) / grid (CSS-Grid auto-fit — set min column width via `Ui.gridColumns N`; right primitive for product grids / dashboards / image galleries; use this NOT `wrappedRow` when card children contain `<img>` because flex-wrap collapses to 1-per-row in that case) / paragraph / textColumn / text / none / html` (`html` is the escape hatch wrapping a Std.Html `Html msg` node) |
| Sized elements | `button` (`{onPress, label}`), `input` (real `<input>`), `form` (`<form>` + `onSubmit msg`), `link` (`{url, label}`), `image` (`{src, description}`) |
| Length | `px Int` / `fill` (bare, no arg) / `fillPortion Int` / `content` / `shrink` / `minimum Int Length` / `maximum Int Length` / `vh Int` (viewport-height %) / `vw Int` (viewport-width %) |
| Padding | `padding Int` / `paddingXY x y` (X-first / Y-second — `paddingXY 24 16` = 24px horizontal, 16px vertical, matches elm-ui) / `paddingEach { top, right, bottom, left }` (record-shaped, matches `Border.widthEach` and elm-ui) / `spacing Int` |
| Alignment | `centerX` / `centerY` / `alignLeft` / `alignRight` / `alignTop` / `alignBottom` / `pointer` |
| Overflow | `clip` / `clipX` / `clipY` / `scrollbars` / `scrollbarX` / `scrollbarY` |
| Nearby (overlays) | `above el` / `below el` / `onLeft el` / `onRight el` / `inFront el` / `behind el` |
| Events (typed) | `onClick msg` / `onSubmit msg` / `onInput (String -> msg)` / `onChange (String -> msg)` / `onFocus msg` / `onMouseOver` / `onMouseOut` / `onKeyDown` / `onFile (String -> msg)` / `onImage (String -> msg)` |
| File / image hints | `fileMaxSize Int` (bytes) / `fileMaxWidth Int` / `fileMaxHeight Int` |
| Colour | `rgb Int Int Int` / `rgba Int Int Int Float` / `white` / `black` / `transparent` |
| Form / attribute helpers | `htmlAttribute key val` / `name "field"` / `style "css-prop" "value"` / `class "name"` |
| Sub-modules | `Std.Ui.Background` (color/image/linearGradient/gradient + hoverColor/focusColor/focusVisibleColor/activeColor/disabledColor), `Std.Ui.Border` (color/width/widthEach/rounded/solid/dashed/dotted/shadow/glow/innerShadow + hoverColor/focusColor/focusVisibleColor/activeColor/hoverWidth/hoverRounded), `Std.Ui.Font` (color/family/size/weight/bold/semiBold/regular/light/extraBold/black/italic/underline/noDecoration/lineThrough/overline/letterSpacing/wordSpacing/alignLeft/alignRight/alignCenter/center/justify + hoverColor/focusColor/focusVisibleColor/activeColor/disabledColor/hoverSize), `Std.Ui.Region` (heading n/mainContent/navigation/footer/aside/label/announce/announceUrgently — renderer dispatches real semantic tags `<h1..h6>`/`<main>`/`<nav>`/`<footer>`/`<aside>` + aria-label/aria-live), `Std.Ui.Input` (button/text/multiline/email/username/search/currentPassword/newPassword/checkbox/radio/radioRow/slider + option + label*/placeholder), `Std.Ui.Lazy` (lazy/lazy2..lazy5 — no-op wrappers today), `Std.Ui.Keyed` (sky-key for diff identity), `Std.Ui.Responsive` (classifyDevice/adapt — Model-driven viewport branching) |
| Media queries (CSS-driven) | `Ui.mediaQuery query [attrs] child` (raw query string escape hatch) / `Ui.breakpoint bp [attrs] child` (typed `Breakpoint`: `mobile / tablet / desktop / smAndUp / mdAndUp / lgAndUp / xlAndUp / darkMode / lightMode / reducedMotion / touchDevice / portrait / landscape / Custom Int Int`). Instant CSS-engine reactivity — no Model field, no JS round-trip, no re-render when the viewport / colour-scheme crosses the breakpoint. Composes via nesting. Renders as a sky-id-scoped `<style>` child on the wrapper. Sky.Tui silently ignores; Sky.Webview matches Sky.Live. Pick `Ui.breakpoint` when the layout transition needs NO typed Msg; pick `Std.Ui.Responsive` when it does. |
| Pseudo-classes (CSS-driven) | Per sub-module `on<State>` helpers (above) + generic `Ui.onPseudo : PseudoClass -> List (Attribute msg) -> Attribute msg` escape hatch for selector combos no sub-module covers. `PseudoClass`: `Ui.hover / Ui.focus / Ui.focusVisible / Ui.active / Ui.disabled`. `focusColor` targets `:focus-visible` (safer default — keyboard nav only, never click-induced focus rings); use `Ui.onPseudo Ui.focus [...]` for sticky-focus. `:hover` rules are AUTO-WRAPPED in `@media (hover: hover)` by the runtime so they don't fire as sticky-hover on touch devices (mobile "tap-and-stay-hovered" bug). Renders a sky-id-scoped `<style data-sky-pc=...>` child. Composes with `Ui.breakpoint` via natural nesting — breakpoint wraps the element, pseudo-rule attaches inside. |
| Transitions + animations (CSS-driven) | `Std.Ui.Transition.attribute [property "background-color", duration 200, easing easeOut]` builds a CSS transition shorthand from typed `Step`s; pair with `Background.hoverColor` to animate the change between base + `:hover`. `Std.Ui.Animation.attribute { name, duration, easing, delay, iterations, fillMode, respectReducedMotion, keyframes }` builds a keyframe spec; `keyframes : List (Int, List Transform.Prop)` from `Std.Ui.Transform` (translateX/Y/scale/rotate/skewX/Y/opacity). BOTH rules AUTO-WRAPPED in `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)` by default for a11y — opt OUT via `Transition.attributeUnsafe` / `respectReducedMotion = False` ONLY when motion is semantically required (loading spinner). `@keyframes` names auto-suffixed with sky-id (`fadeIn__r_1_div_0`) so cross-element name collisions can't happen. Renders sky-id-scoped `<style data-sky-tr=...>` + `<style data-sky-anim=...>` children. Sky.Tui silently ignores; Sky.Webview matches Sky.Live. |
| Aspect ratio (CSS-driven) | `Ui.aspectRatio Float` (`Ui.aspectRatio 1.777`) / `Ui.aspectRatioWH Int Int` (`Ui.aspectRatioWH 16 9`) / convenience aliases `Ui.square` (1:1), `Ui.widescreen` / `Ui.fullHd` (16:9), `Ui.cinemascope` (2.35:1). Compiles to inline `aspect-ratio: <r>` CSS; pair with `Ui.width Ui.fill` so the unset axis auto-scales via the browser's aspect-ratio solver. Indispensable for video embeds, image galleries, hero banners, avatar tiles. Sky.Tui ignores (ANSI cells have no aspect-ratio); Sky.Webview honours via embedded WebKit/Chromium. |
| Grid tracks (typed CSS-grid) | `Ui.gridColumns N` stays for the common-case product-card grid (lowers to `repeat(auto-fill, minmax(Npx, 1fr))`). For sidebar layouts / content-aware tracks / `repeat(auto-fit, minmax(...))` responsive card grids, reach for `Std.Ui.Grid` — typed `Track` ADT (`fr`, `px`, `auto`, `minContent`, `maxContent`, `minmax`, `repeat`, `repeatAutoFit`, `repeatAutoFill`) + attribute entry points `Grid.tracks cols rows` / `Grid.columns cols` / `Grid.rows rs`. Examples: `Grid.columns [ Grid.fr 1, Grid.px 200, Grid.fr 1 ]` (sidebar); `Grid.columns [ Grid.repeatAutoFit (Grid.minmax (Grid.px 240) (Grid.fr 1)) ]` (responsive cards). Both surfaces lower to inline CSS via the existing AttrStyle channel — no runtime injection. |

**Idioms when writing Sky.Ui:**

1. **Forms with sensitive inputs use `Ui.form` + `Ui.onSubmit DoSignIn`, NOT `onInput` per keystroke on the password field.** The wire driver decodes formData `{"username":"...","password":"..."}` into a typed `LoginForm` record via case-insensitive `json.Unmarshal`. Three wins: password manager extensions stop seeing DOM mutations on every render, the secret never enters Model so never serialises into Redis/Postgres/Firestore session stores, race-free submit reads live DOM not a debounced keystroke. The username MAY round-trip via `value` + `onInput`; the password MUST NOT.

2. **For real `<input>` elements use `Ui.input`, NOT `Ui.el [ htmlAttribute "type" "text" ]`.** `Ui.el` builds `Node` which renders as `<div>` — browsers ignore `type=`/`value=` on non-input elements and never fire input events on a div. `Ui.input` builds `TaggedNode "input"` for void emission.

3. **For Std.Ui-heavy views (~25+ polymorphic `Element Msg` helpers), split the view layer across multiple modules.** Single monolithic Main.sky can blow the HM type-checker heap (Limitation #17). Canonical split: `State.sky` (types + pure helpers, no Std.Ui) / `Update.sky` / `View/Common.sky` / one View module per page / `Main.sky` dispatcher. See `examples/19-skyforum`.

4. **`Input.*` size / layout attrs apply to the wrapper, form attrs stay on the inner control.** Every `Std.Ui.Input.*` (text / multiline / email / username / search / currentPassword / newPassword / slider / checkbox / radio / radioRow) routes layout attrs (`Ui.width`/`Ui.height`/`Ui.padding`/`Ui.spacing`/`Ui.alignX`/`Ui.alignY`/`Ui.nearby`/`Ui.pointer`/`Ui.overflow`) to the outer wrapper `wrapWithLabel` emits, while form / event / visual attrs stay on the inner `<input>` / `<textarea>`. So `Input.multiline [Ui.height Ui.fill] {...}` inside a column-fill parent fills the parent; `Background.color (Ui.rgb 240 240 240)` colours the textarea itself, not the wrapper.

5. **`Ui.fill` lowers asymmetrically (v0.15.55+, refined v0.15.56 F4).** Main-axis fill emits `flex-grow: N; min-{w,h}: 0;`. Cross-axis HEIGHT fill (row child) emits NOTHING — relies on flex default `align-items: stretch`. Cross-axis WIDTH fill (column / el / textColumn child) emits `width: 100%;` (no `align-self`). The asymmetry closes the cross-axis collapse class (issue #63 — Input.multiline + three-pane app shell), where the pre-v0.15.55 `height: 100%` resolved against an indefinite flex-grow-derived parent height and collapsed children to text-content height. Width keeps `100%` because column-parent widths are typically definite AND it protects `[Ui.width fill, Ui.centerX]` (showcase outer column shape) from collapsing when `align-self: center` overrides the implicit stretch. **F4 single-emission contract**: cross-axis fill no longer emits redundant `align-self: stretch` — at most one `align-self` declaration per element, sourced from `alignSelfX/Y` only.

6. **`Ui.layoutWith { wrapperAttrs, rootAttrs }` reaches the page wrapper (v0.15.56).** `Ui.layout attrs el` puts `attrs` on the root child; the outer 100 vh wrapper is hardcoded. `Ui.layoutWith` is the additive entry point that lets `wrapperAttrs` reach the wrapper itself (page-wide `Background.color` for dark mode, `Font.color` / `Font.family` cascading to every descendant, `Border` / class / aria-* / data-* attrs that need to sit on the page wrapper for analytics or a11y landmark routing). `Ui.layout attrs el` is exactly `Ui.layoutWith { wrapperAttrs = [], rootAttrs = attrs } el` — byte-identical for existing call sites.

7. **Pseudo-class / animation / transition rules on void elements work (v0.15.57+ — #409).** `Background.activeColor` / `hoverColor` / `focusColor` (and the equivalent on `Std.Ui.Animation` / `Std.Ui.Transition` / `Ui.breakpoint`) all emit a sky-id-scoped `<style>` element to apply the rule. For non-void elements (`<div>`, `<button>`, etc.) the runtime prepends that `<style>` as a first child. For VOID elements (`<input>`, `<img>`, `<br>`, `<hr>`, …) the runtime hoists it to a SIBLING slot immediately AFTER the void element — same CSS selector, applies correctly. So `Input.text [Background.activeColor (Ui.rgb 200 100 50)] cfg` now styles the inner `<input>` on `:active`, where pre-v0.15.57 the rule was silently dropped. No call-site change needed — the runtime fix is transparent.

8. **`Ui.html` is the raw escape hatch — no Sky.Ui wrapper, no inline-style injection.** `Ui.html (Html.node "canvas" [...] [])` wraps an arbitrary `Std.Html` node as an Element. The wrapped node renders verbatim in the parent's flex layout: no inline-style wrapper, no `data-sky-*` attrs added, no children manipulation. The user is responsible for whatever sizing / styling / event handling they want on the wrapped node. Useful for `<video>`, `<canvas>`, third-party widgets, or any tag Sky.Ui doesn't model directly. Note: a raw `<div>` inside a `Ui.row` participates as a flex item alongside typed siblings (x-ordering correct, sizing preserved). DON'T use `Ui.html` for layout — use `Ui.el` / `Ui.row` / `Ui.column` so Sky.Ui's flex pipeline can manage the geometry.

**File / image upload pattern:**
```elm
type Msg = ... | AvatarSelected String | ...

Ui.input
    [ Ui.htmlAttribute "type" "file"
    , Ui.htmlAttribute "accept" "image/*"
    , Ui.onImage AvatarSelected           -- AvatarSelected : String -> Msg
    , Ui.fileMaxSize   2_000_000          -- 2MB browser-side cap (UX, not security)
    , Ui.fileMaxWidth  800                -- auto-resize + JPEG @ 0.85 before upload
    , Ui.fileMaxHeight 800
    ]
```
Callback receives a data URL (`data:image/jpeg;base64,...`). Decode with `Std.Encoding.base64Decode` → `Http.post` to upload. Server `[live] maxBodyBytes` in `sky.toml` should be ≥ your `fileMaxSize` (default 5 MiB).

**Style + workaround tips:**
- **Annotations**: when annotating a top-level returning `Element`, use `import Std.Ui exposing (Element)` and write the bare `Element Msg` form, NOT the qualified `Ui.Element Msg`. Sky's canonicaliser strips type parameters from qualified-alias type references (separate compiler bug, tracked), so `Ui.Element Msg` resolves as `Element` (no parameter) and unification fails. The bare-name pattern works correctly and is what every example uses. Note: `Ui.none` itself is fine — the workaround is on the annotation shape, not the value.
- **Empty list in seed data**: use record-literal syntax (`{ id = 1, ..., tags = [], ... }`) rather than positional constructor (`Item 1 ... []`) when an `[]` field needs typed-slice coercion. The field's type alias gives the typed codegen the target type.

### Escape Hatch & View Types

```elm
-- `js` is a Prelude function for embedding raw JS/Go expressions (use sparingly)
js : String -> a

-- View functions should annotate their return type as `Html msg`:
view : Model -> Html msg
view model =
    div [] [ text "hello" ]
```

### Sky.Core.Time (mixed pure + Task)

```elm
Time.now ()            -- Task Error Int (Unix millis)
Time.format "2006-01-02" millis  -- pure: "2025-03-25"
Time.parse "2006-01-02" "2025-03-25"  -- Result Error Int
Time.year millis, Time.month, Time.day, Time.hour, Time.minute, Time.second
Time.sleep 1000        -- Task Error () (sleep 1 second)
```

### Sky.Core.Http (Task)

```elm
Http.get "https://api.example.com/data"     -- Task Error HttpResponse
Http.post url body                          -- Task Error HttpResponse

-- HttpResponse = { status : Int, body : String, headers : Dict String String }

-- Build a custom request with the builder API (typed):
Http.defaultRequest "https://api.example.com/v1/foo"
    |> Http.withMethod "POST"
    |> Http.withHeader "Authorization" ("Bearer " ++ token)
    |> Http.withBody jsonBody
    |> Http.withTimeout 60000              -- 60 s; 0 disables
    |> Http.request                         -- Task Error HttpResponse

-- Retry on transient errors (uniform Sky.Core.Task surface):
--
--   * `RetryPolicy e` carries the body-Task's error type.
--   * `ShouldRetry e = RetryAlways | RetryWhen (e -> Bool)` is the
--     HM-pure predicate ADT (replaces `shouldRetry : any` from
--     v0.15.44). `RetryAlways` is the default in every fresh
--     policy; `retryOn` (or its `with*` alias `withRetryOn`)
--     wraps a typed predicate in `RetryWhen`.
import Sky.Core.Error as Error

-- Default: retry every Err (RetryAlways).
policyA = Task.exponentialBackoff 3 500

-- Typed-predicate: only retry transient errors (RetryWhen).
policyB =
    Task.exponentialBackoff 3 500
        |> Task.withJitter
        |> Task.retryOn Error.isRetryable

-- Builder pattern (mirror of `Http.defaultRequest |> Http.withTimeout`):
-- Note: `defaultRetryPolicy` returns `RetryPolicy e` polymorphic in
-- `e`; when threading a typed predicate (`Error -> Bool`) through the
-- builder chain, start from `exponentialBackoff` / `linearBackoff`
-- instead — they specialise `e` at the call site.
policyC =
    Task.exponentialBackoff 5 250
        |> Task.withJitter
        |> Task.withRetryOn Error.isRetryable

-- Pure builder chain (untyped predicate stays generic):
policyD =
    Task.defaultRetryPolicy
        |> Task.withMaxAttempts 5
        |> Task.withBaseMs 250
        |> Task.withKind 1

fetchToken : Task Error String
fetchToken =
    Task.retryWith policyB
        (Http.get tokenUrl |> Task.map (\resp -> resp.body))

Http.parseQuery "a=1&b=2"   -- Dict String String (pure; Go net/url)
```

### Sky.Core.Http.Stream (Task + Sub) — incremental HTTP bodies

Read HTTP response bodies as bytes arrive — the view re-renders
progressively (LLM streaming, SSE, long downloads). Drops perceived
latency 5-10× vs `Http.get`.

```elm
import Sky.Core.Http.Stream as HttpStream exposing (StreamId, ChunkEvent(..))

HttpStream.open req              -- Task Error StreamId — completes once HEADERS arrive
HttpStream.chunks sid f          -- Sub msg — `f : ChunkEvent -> msg` per chunk
HttpStream.close sid             -- Task Error () — idempotent
HttpStream.forEachChunk sid body -- Task Error () — synchronous drain
                                 -- body : String -> Task Error ()

type ChunkEvent
    = Chunk String       -- UTF-8 bytes just arrived
    | Done               -- clean EOF
    | Errored Error      -- network / protocol fault
```

**Two ways to consume a stream:**

1. **Sub-based** (`chunks`) — for Sky.Live apps. The runtime
   dispatches `ChunkEvent` Msgs through the update loop. Subscribe
   only while in-flight: store `StreamId` on the model after
   `StreamOpened (Ok sid)`, clear on `Chunked Done` / `Errored`,
   return `Sub.none` when Nothing. See `examples/28-streaming-chat`.

2. **Synchronous** (`forEachChunk`) — for plain Sky.Http.Server
   handler goroutines (NO Sub mechanism available). Blocks until
   upstream EOF / error; calls `body` per chunk. Fail-fast on body
   `Err`. Always closes the handle on exit. Canonical relay shape:

   ```elm
   handleRelay req =
       Server.Stream.stream "text/event-stream" (\writer ->
           HttpStream.open upstreamReq
               |> Task.andThen (\hdl ->
                   HttpStream.forEachChunk hdl
                       (\chunk -> Server.Stream.emit chunk writer))
               |> Task.andThen (\_ -> Server.Stream.finish writer))
   ```

   See `examples/32-sse-relay` for the runnable reference. Full
   design write-up in `docs/skylive/http-streaming.md`.

Session disconnect (TTL eviction OR Delete) closes every owned
Sub-registered stream automatically; log: `[sky.stream] cleaned N
orphaned streams on session close`. forEachChunk-owned streams
self-close on exit.

### Sky.Http.Server.Stream (Task) — incremental HTTP responses

Mirror image of `Sky.Core.Http.Stream`: a `Sky.Http.Server`
handler emits chunks back to its HTTP client one piece at a time
instead of buffering the whole body.  Use for SSE, LLM token
forwarding, chunked downloads.

```elm
import Sky.Http.Server.Stream as Stream exposing (StreamWriter)

Stream.stream            -- String -> (StreamWriter -> Task Error ()) -> Task Error Response
Stream.emit              -- String -> StreamWriter -> Task Error ()       (writes + flushes)
Stream.finish            -- StreamWriter -> Task Error ()                 (idempotent; implicit at handler return)
Stream.withContentType   -- String -> StreamWriter -> Task Error ()       (best-effort; pre-emit only)
```

Canonical SSE handler:

```elm
handleEvents : Request -> Task Error Response
handleEvents _ =
    Stream.stream "text/event-stream" (\writer ->
        Stream.emit "event: hello\ndata: 1\n\n" writer
            |> Task.andThen (\_ -> Time.sleep 100)
            |> Task.andThen (\_ -> Stream.emit "event: tick\ndata: 2\n\n" writer)
            |> Task.andThen (\_ -> Stream.finish writer))
```

Dispatcher writes headers + flushes BEFORE the handler runs (SSE
requires `Content-Type: text/event-stream` visible before the
first event).  Underlying `http.ResponseWriter` must implement
`http.Flusher` — middleware wrapping that strips it gets a clean
`503 Service Unavailable` instead of silent buffering.  CSRF
auto-injection is skipped (streaming bodies aren't form-bearing
HTML); security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options,
Referrer-Policy) apply identically to buffered responses.

`emit` after `finish` is a no-op.  Client disconnect mid-stream
returns `Err (ErrNetwork ...)` from the next `emit`.  Single-
goroutine emit ordering per request (Go's `http.Handler`
convention) — linearise concurrent emits via `Task.andThen`.

See `examples/30-sse-server-demo` for a runnable demo +
`docs/skylive/http-streaming.md` §"Server-side" for the design
write-up.

### Sky.Core.WebSocket + Sky.Http.Server.WebSocket (v0.15.46+)

Bidirectional WebSocket — collab editors, multiplayer, bidirectional
LLM chat, financial feeds.  Two mirror modules:
`Sky.Core.WebSocket` (outbound client) + `Sky.Http.Server.WebSocket`
(server-side upgrade).

**Client side** — `Sky.Live` shape (Sub-driven receive):

```elm
import Sky.Core.WebSocket as Ws exposing (WebSocketMessage(..))

-- Open
( model, Cmd.perform (Ws.connect "wss://api.example.com/feed") Connected )

-- Receive
subscriptions model =
    case model.socket of
        Just sock -> Sub.batch [ Ws.onMessage sock GotFrame, Ws.onClose sock SocketClosed ]
        Nothing   -> Sub.none

-- Send
Cmd.perform (Ws.send sock "hello") Sent
```

`Ws.connect : String -> Task Error WebSocket`,
`Ws.connectWith : WebSocketCfg -> Task Error WebSocket`,
`Ws.send` / `Ws.sendBinary` / `Ws.close` /
`Ws.closeWithCode`, plus the four Sub helpers `Ws.onOpen` /
`Ws.onMessage` / `Ws.onClose` / `Ws.onError`.  Build the cfg via
`Ws.defaultCfg url |> Ws.withHeaders [...] |> Ws.withTimeout 5000
|> Ws.withPingInterval 30000`.

**Server side** — turn any `Sky.Http.Server` route into a
WebSocket upgrade endpoint by returning `Ws.upgrade req cfg`:

```elm
import Sky.Http.Server.WebSocket as Ws

handleWs : Request -> Task Error Response
handleWs req =
    Ws.upgrade req
        (Ws.defaultCfg
            |> Ws.withOnConnect (\sock -> Ws.sendToClient sock "welcome!")
            |> Ws.withOnMessage (\sock msg -> Ws.sendToClient sock ("echo: " ++ msg))
            |> Ws.withOnClose   (\_    -> Task.succeed ())
            |> Ws.withOriginPatterns [ "https://*.example.com" ]
        )
```

`Ws.sendToClient` / `Ws.sendBinaryToClient` for individual peers;
`Ws.broadcast peers text` for fan-out (tolerates partial failure);
`Ws.closeClient` for explicit disconnect.

| Concern | Default |
|---|---|
| Handshake timeout | 30 s |
| Heartbeat ping | 30 s (`withPingInterval 0` disables) |
| Max message size | 1 MiB (`withMaxMessageBytes`) |
| Origin gate | empty `originPatterns` REJECTS in production (403); dev allows all |
| Read buffer | 64 frames per socket |
| `send` backpressure | blocks up to 30 s on a slow consumer |

**Stdlib typed-record convention (v0.15.46+).** Every public
typed record (`WebSocketCfg`, `WebSocketServerCfg`,
`HttpRequest`, …) ships with a `default*` constructor + at least
one `with*` builder per field.  Always compose via builders — a
new optional field in a patch release would break a record
literal.

See `examples/33-websocket-echo` for the canonical pattern.

### Sky.Core.Encoding (pure)

```elm
Encoding.base64Encode "Hello"   -- "SGVsbG8="
Encoding.base64Decode "SGVsbG8="  -- Ok "Hello"
Encoding.urlEncode "hello world"  -- "hello+world"
Encoding.hexEncode "Hi"           -- "4869"
```

### Sky.Core.Regex (pure)

```elm
Regex.match "[0-9]+" "abc123"        -- True
Regex.find "[0-9]+" "abc123def"      -- Just "123"
Regex.findAll "[0-9]+" "a1b2c3"      -- ["1", "2", "3"]
Regex.replace "[0-9]" "#" "abc123"   -- "abc###"
Regex.split "[,;]" "a,b;c"           -- ["a", "b", "c"]
```

### Sky.Core.Crypto (pure)

```elm
Crypto.sha256 "hello"               -- "2cf24dba..." (also sha512, sha1, md5)
Crypto.hmacSha256 "key" "msg"       -- hex HMAC (also hmacSha512)
Crypto.rsaSha256Sign pemKey "msg"   -- Result Error String — RS256 signature
Crypto.rsaSha256Verify pub "msg" s  -- Bool
Crypto.constantTimeEqual a b        -- compare secrets safely, never ==

-- Symmetric encryption (AEAD).  Output: base64(nonce || ct || tag).
key = Crypto.aesKeyFromPassword "password" "salt-must-be-unique"
Crypto.aesGcmEncrypt key "plaintext"    -- Result Error String
Crypto.aesGcmDecrypt key ciphertext     -- Result Error String
Crypto.chacha20Encrypt key plaintext    -- AES alternative on ARM / mobile
Crypto.chacha20Decrypt key ciphertext
```

### Sky.Core.Bytes (pure)

```elm
import Sky.Core.Bytes as Bytes

Bytes.fromHex "deadbeef"    -- Maybe Bytes
Bytes.toHex bytes           -- String
Bytes.fromBase64 "SGVsbG8=" -- Maybe Bytes
Bytes.toBase64 bytes        -- String
Bytes.toString bytes        -- Maybe String — Nothing on invalid UTF-8
Bytes.length bytes          -- byte count
```

`Bytes` is a `type alias = String` — Go strings are byte sequences, no
opaque-wrapper round-trip needed.  Use `Bytes` when you want the
intent (this string holds raw bytes, not text) to read in your type
signatures.

### Sky.Core.Jwt (pure)

```elm
import Sky.Core.Jwt as Jwt

token =
    Jwt.encode (Jwt.hs256 secret)
        (Jwt.claims |> Jwt.subject "u1" |> Jwt.expiresAt 1999999999)
-- token : Result Error String

payload = Jwt.decode (Jwt.hs256 secret) now token
-- verifies the signature + exp/nbf against `now` → Result Error String
```

`Jwt.rs256 pemKey` selects RS256 (GitHub Apps, service accounts) —
pass the private key to `encode`, the public key to `decode`.

### Sky.Core.Random (Task)

```elm
Random.int 1 100           -- Task Error Int
Random.float ()             -- Task Error Float (0.0 to 1.0)
Random.choice ["a","b","c"] -- Task Error (Maybe String)
Random.shuffle [1,2,3,4]    -- Task Error (List Int)
```

### Sky.Http.Server

Every binding carries an HM signature (v0.15.44+).  `sky doc
Server.get` returns the real type; LSP hover surfaces `String ->
(Request -> Task Error Response) -> Route`.

`Handler` is exported as a transparent alias for
`Request -> Task Error Response`.  Annotate handlers at head
position (v0.16.4+):

```elm
import Sky.Http.Server as Server exposing (Request, Response, Handler)

handleHome : Handler
handleHome _ =
    Task.succeed (Server.text "Hello!")

main =
    Server.listen 8000
        [ Server.get "/" handleHome
        , Server.get "/api/users/:id" getUser
        , Server.post "/api/data" handlePost
        , Server.static "/assets" "./public"
        ]

-- Request  = { method, path, body, headers, params, query, cookies, remoteAddr }
-- Response = { status, body, headers, contentType }
-- Response builders: text, json, html, withStatus, withHeader, withCookie, redirect
-- Cookie:   Server.cookie "name" "value" -- pair with Server.withCookie
```

### Sky Console — auto-mounted dev dashboard

Every Sky.Live AND Sky.Http.Server app **automatically gets a
Std.Ui-rendered dev console at `/_sky/console`** in dev mode.
Zero user code needed — visit the path or click the floating
"🔍 Console" link injected bottom-right of every page.

The console is its own self-contained Sky.Live mini-app
(`sky-bundled/console/`) reverse-proxied from a child process —
no shared state with your app, no extra port (everything on your
existing listener). Production-detection auto-suppresses both
the banner and the mount.

**Production-mode gate** (single source of truth): `ENV` (or
`SKY_ENV`) **unset** OR one of `{dev, development, local}` →
console + banner SHOWN. Anything else (`production`, `prod`,
`staging`, `qa`, `preview`, …) → console + banner HIDDEN and
`/_sky/metrics` requires Bearer auth.

```bash
# Local dev — console is at http://localhost:8000/_sky/console
sky run

# Staging / prod — banner gone, console mount gone, metrics gated
ENV=production ./sky-out/app

# Ad-hoc standalone — no host app needed
sky console            # http://localhost:8025
sky console --tui      # ... or in the terminal via Sky.Tui

# Override the banner's link target (e.g. point at a remote shared console)
SKY_CONSOLE_URL=https://internal-dash.staging.example.com ./sky-out/app

# Opt out of the auto-spawn (banner stays linkable if you mount your own)
SKY_CONSOLE_EMBED=off ./sky-out/app

# Opt out of just the banner chrome (mount stays active)
SKY_DEV_BANNER=off ./sky-out/app
```

### Sub-app mount — host any Sky app under a URL prefix

The console is the first user of `rt.MountSubApp`. The same
primitive lets you mount any other Sky app (or arbitrary HTTP
server) under a path prefix on the parent's mux. Each sub-app
runs as its OWN child process — independent session store,
independent observability namespace, zero shared state — but
**single port for the user, single process tree for supervision**
(children die when the parent exits).

Use cases: billing widget at `/billing`, admin panel at `/admin`,
docs site at `/docs`, mini-app per feature team. Each can be
written + deployed independently and composed at the URL level.

The Go-side API (use from generated code or via a post-build
patch; Sky-side ergonomic API tracked for v0.14):

```go
import "sky-app/rt"

// Mount an external Sky binary as a sub-app:
rt.MountSubApp(mux, "/billing", rt.SpawnBinary("./billing-app"))
rt.MountSubApp(mux, "/admin",   rt.SpawnBinary("./admin-app"))

// Or any non-Sky HTTP server (gives you `127.0.0.1:port` + a
// reverse-proxy mount under the prefix):
rt.MountSubApp(mux, "/docs", rt.SpawnBinary("./hugo-server"))
```

Each sub-app gets its mount prefix in `SKY_LIVE_BASE_PATH` so its
inlined JS prefixes `/_sky/event` etc. correctly. SSE survives
the proxy hop (no buffering). Children spawn in their own process
group so a Ctrl-C on the parent's terminal doesn't multi-kill;
the parent's signal handler tears children down cleanly with a
2 s SIGTERM grace then SIGKILL.

**Universal observability (shipped)**: every sub-app's logs,
metrics, and trace spans automatically push to the parent's
`/_sky/observability/ingest` endpoint, labelled by
`subapp=<namespace>`. Parent's `/_sky/metrics` exposes the full
process tree in one Prometheus exposition — `subapp="billing"`,
`subapp="admin"`, etc. The console reads aggregated data via
`/_sky/console/api/*`; PromQL queries can `sum by (subapp)`. No
config needed — auto-wires when `MountSubApp` spawns the child
(passes `SKY_PARENT_URL` + `SKY_LIVE_NAMESPACE` +
`SKY_INGEST_TOKEN` env). Auth via shared token, CSRF-exempt.

## Sky.Live — Server-Driven UI

For interactive web apps, Sky.Live generates an HTTP server with server-side DOM diffing (similar architectural style to Phoenix LiveView):

```elm
import Std.Html exposing (..)
import Std.Html.Attributes exposing (..)
import Std.Css exposing (..)
import Std.Live exposing (app, route)
import Std.Html.Events exposing (onClick, onInput, onSubmit)
import Std.Cmd as Cmd
import Std.Sub as Sub
import Std.Time as Time

type Page = HomePage | AboutPage
type alias Model = { page : Page, count : Int }
type Msg = Navigate Page | Increment | Tick

init _ = ({ page = HomePage, count = 0 }, Cmd.none)

update msg model =
    case msg of
        Navigate p -> ({ model | page = p }, Cmd.none)
        Increment -> ({ model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none)
        Tick -> ({ model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none)

subscriptions model =
    case model.page of
        HomePage -> Time.every 1000 Tick    -- server-push via SSE
        _ -> Sub.none

view model =
    div []
        [ styleNode [] (stylesheet [ rule "body" [ fontFamily "sans-serif" ] ])
        , h1 [] [ text (String.fromInt model.count) ]
        , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
        ]

main =
    app
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes = [ route "/" HomePage, route "/about" AboutPage ]
        , notFound = HomePage
        }
```

**Navigation**: `a [ href "/about", attribute "sky-nav" "" ] [ text "About" ]`
**Styling**: Use `Std.Css` with `stylesheet`/`rule` — not inline style strings.

### Per-page `<head>` injection (Sky.Live)

Add an optional `head : Model -> List (Html msg)` field to the
`app` cfg to inject per-page `<title>`, SEO meta tags, canonical
URLs, Open Graph, Twitter Card, JSON-LD, theme-color, favicons,
etc. Helpers live in `Std.Live.Head`. The field is row-open on
the HM signature — apps that omit it build unchanged.

```elm
import Std.Live.Head as Head

headFor model =
    [ Head.title (titleFor model.page)
    , Head.meta "description" (descriptionFor model.page)
    , Head.canonical (canonicalFor model.page)
    , Head.metaProperty "og:title" (titleFor model.page)
    , Head.metaProperty "og:image" "https://example.com/og.png"
    , Head.themeColor "#1a1a2e"
    , Head.jsonLd (jsonLdFor model.page)   -- raw JSON string
    ]

main =
    app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes = [ ... ], notFound = HomePage
        , head = headFor
        }
```

`Std.Live.Head` helpers: `title` / `meta name content` /
`metaProperty property content` / `link [(k, v)...]` (arbitrary
attrs) / `canonical href` / `jsonLd body` / `themeColor color` /
`rss href feedTitle`. SSE patches scope to `<body>`, so head
updates require a full reload — fine for the typical "head
depends on page identity" case (in-app navigation already does a
full-body sky-nav fetch + history push).

### URL routing + history (Sky.Live)

`routes` is the URL → Page mapping; the runtime matches in
declaration order, captures `:param` segments, and reflect-calls
the Page constructor with the captured values (`String`).

```elm
type Page
    = LoginPage
    | DashboardPage
    | NewAppPage
    | AppDetailPage String          -- :slug delivers a String
    | InsightsPage

main = app
    { …
    , routes =
        [ route "/" LoginPage
        , route "/apps" DashboardPage
        , route "/apps/new" NewAppPage           -- literal BEFORE pattern
        , route "/apps/:slug" AppDetailPage      -- ctor: String -> Page
        , route "/insights" InsightsPage
        ]
    , notFound = LoginPage
    }
```

Put literals before patterns — otherwise `"new"` matches as a
slug.

**URL-from-Page.** After a programmatic `Navigate` Msg, the
address bar follows via Sky.Live's `data-sky-path` hook — a typed
attribute the runtime checks on EVERY patch (`__skyPatch` for
sky-nav fetches, `__skyApplyPatches` for SSE-driven Msg patches).
No JS-in-string, no `new Function()`, CSP-safe.

```elm
import Std.Html as Html
import Std.Html.Attributes as Attr

urlSync : Model -> Element msg
urlSync model =
    Ui.html
        (Html.node "div"
            [ Attr.attribute "data-sky-path" (currentPath model) ]
            []
        )

-- Place urlSync inside the view's top-level column.
```

Do NOT remove the `data-sky-path` element after the runtime
processes it — Sky.Live's diff looks elements up by `sky-id` via
querySelector, and a removed element orphans its sky-id so the next
attribute patch silently skips. The path-check is idempotent so
leaving it in place is cheap.

**Link clicks.** Add the `sky-nav` attribute to an `<a>`: the
runtime intercepts the click, fetches with `X-Sky-Nav: 1`,
full-body-patches, and pushes history. No app code needed.
`Back/Forward` is handled by a built-in popstate listener — also
no app code.

`data-sky-eval` (older, runs the attribute via `new Function()`)
is CSP-incompatible and only fires from `__skyPatch`, not from
SSE patches. Always prefer `data-sky-path` for URL updates.

**Auth-gated routing pattern.** Outer-case `pageBody` on
`model.session` (signed-out always renders sign-in regardless of
page) and have a single `currentPath : Model -> String` that
returns `/auth/sign-in` when unauthed, so the URL follows the
surface the user actually sees.

```elm
currentPath : Model -> String
currentPath model =
    case model.session of
        Nothing -> "/auth/sign-in"
        Just _ ->
            case model.page of
                LoginPage          -> "/apps"           -- authed at sign-in → bounce
                DashboardPage      -> "/apps"
                NewAppPage         -> "/apps/new"
                AppDetailPage slug -> "/apps/" ++ slug
                InsightsPage       -> "/insights"
```

**Slug ↔ subdomain.** When apps deploy under a wildcard domain
(`*.platform.app`), prefer slug-keyed URLs (`/apps/<slug>`) that
match the subdomain (`<slug>.platform.app`) — bookmarkable, follows
renames. Carry the slug on the Page constructor; handlers that need
the numeric id resolve via a `findBySlug` helper.

### Event binding — radio groups

Sky.Live's `input`/`change` event on a `<input type="radio">` reports the radio's `checked` state (always `True` at selection), NOT its `value`. Binding a typed constructor like `UpdateRole : String -> Msg` to `onInput` gets a `Bool` at runtime, which the server drops as a Msg decode error.

**Use `onClick` with a fully-applied Msg per radio** (same pattern for per-choice checkboxes):

```elm
-- One <label> per choice, each carrying a zero-arg Msg.
choiceRow =
    label [ for "role-guardian", onClick (UpdateRole "guardian") ]
        [ input [ type "radio", name "role", value "guardian", id "role-guardian" ] []
        , text "Guardian"
        ]
```

The browser toggles the radio natively via the `for`/`id` pairing; the Msg ADT arrives on the server already applied (no wire-level type coercion). This is the recommended TEA pattern for radio groups.

### Dispatch error handling

Sky.Live's dispatcher is wrapped in `defer/recover`. If your `update`/`view`/`guard` panics — or a wire-level Msg decode mismatches a constructor type — the event is dropped cleanly, the session model is NOT mutated, and a diagnostic is written to stderr (`[sky.live] dispatch panic recovered …` or `[sky.live] Msg decode error …`). The client sees an empty patch list and the DOM stays as-is. Check server logs when an event appears to "do nothing".

### Sky.Live Component Protocol

Components are separate modules with their own `Model`/`Msg`/`update`/`view`. The compiler auto-wires message routing.

```elm
-- Counter.sky
module Counter exposing (..)

type alias Counter = { count : Int, label : String }

type Msg = Increment | Decrement | Reset

initWith : String -> Counter
initWith label = { count = 0, label = label }

update : Msg -> Counter -> (Counter, Cmd Msg)
update msg counter =
    case msg of
        Increment -> ({ counter | count = counter.count + 1 }, Cmd.none)
        _ -> (counter, Cmd.none)

-- View takes a Msg wrapper function from parent
view : (Msg -> parentMsg) -> Counter -> Html msg
view toMsg counter =
    div []
        [ text (String.fromInt counter.count)
        , button [ onClick (toMsg Increment) ] [ text "+" ]
        ]
```

```elm
-- Main.sky (parent)
type alias Model = { myCounter : Counter.Counter }
type Msg = CounterMsg Counter.Msg | ...

-- In view:
Counter.view CounterMsg model.myCounter
```

### Subscriptions & Time (SSE Server-Push)

`Sub msg` drives server-sent events. The Go runtime walks the subscription tree to set up SSE.

```elm
-- Timer: fires Tick every 1000ms via SSE
subscriptions model = Time.every 1000 Tick

-- Conditional subscription
subscriptions model =
    if model.autoRefresh then
        Time.every 5000 RefreshData
    else
        Sub.none

-- Multiple subscriptions
subscriptions model =
    Sub.batch
        [ Time.every 1000 Tick
        , Time.every 5000 RefreshData
        ]
```

The runtime uses per-session locking and optimistic concurrency (version field) to prevent race conditions between SSE ticks and user events, even across multiple server instances sharing a database.

### Cmd (Side Effects)

`Cmd.none` is used in most cases. `Cmd.batch` combines multiple commands.

```elm
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment ->
            ( { model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none )

        MultipleSideEffects ->
            ( model, Cmd.batch [ cmd1, cmd2 ] )
```

## Sky.Tui — Terminal-Rendering TEA (experimental, v0.12)

Same `init` / `update` / `view` / `subscriptions` shape as Sky.Live,
but the view returns `Element Msg` and the runtime paints to ANSI
terminal cells. The same `Std.Ui` element tree renders in both
backends.

```elm
import Std.Tui as Tui
import Std.Ui as Ui
import Std.Ui exposing (Element)

view : Model -> Element Msg
view model =
    Ui.column
        [ Ui.padding 16, Ui.spacing 8 ]
        [ Ui.text ("Count: " ++ String.fromInt model.count)
        , Ui.row [ Ui.spacing 8 ]
            [ Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Decrement, label = Ui.text "−" }
            , Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Increment, label = Ui.text "+" }
            ]
        ]

main =
    Tui.app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        }
        |> Task.run
```

Optional fields on `Tui.app`'s record:
- `onKey : KeyEvent -> Msg` — global keypress handler. KeyEvent =
  `{ kind, value, shift, alt, ctrl }`. `kind` is one of `"char"`,
  `"enter"`, `"tab"`, `"space"`, `"backspace"`, `"escape"`, `"up"`,
  `"down"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"home"`, `"end"`, `"delete"`,
  `"pageup"`, `"pagedown"`, `"ctrl"`, `"fn"`, `"paste"`, `"mouse"`,
  `"other"`. The runtime hard-exits on Ctrl-C if `onKey` is absent.
- `guard : Msg -> Model -> Result Error ()` — same shape as
  Live.app's auth-guard middleware. Portable across backends.
- `canvasWidth` / `canvasHeight : Int` — logical-pixel canvas
  default 1280×720. Override for denser layout.

Mouse: left-press fires onClick on hit-tested focusables; scroll
wheel scrolls the viewport. Release / drag / middle / right-click
deferred for v0.12.

Buttons activate on Enter AND Space when focused (browser
convention). Tab / Shift-Tab cycle focus; arrow keys also navigate
on non-input focusables.

Teardown: Ctrl-C, SIGTERM/HUP/QUIT, panic, `System.exit` all
restore the terminal (alt-screen exit, raw mode off, mouse
tracking off, DECSTR soft reset).

Sky.Cli is the line-oriented variant — non-raw terminal, view
returns `String`, update consumes lines. `Cli.readPassword () :
Task Error String` reads stdin with echo disabled.

Run `sky run src/Main.sky` for examples 20-24:
- 20-cli-counter (Sky.Cli)
- 21-tui-stopwatch
- 22-tui-stopwatch-ui (Std.Ui — same view function works under Sky.Live)
- 23-tui-todo
- 24-tui-kitchen-sink

Full reference: `docs/skytui/overview.md`.

### Cross-backend: same `view` + `update` for Sky.Live AND Sky.Tui

Split into `App.sky` (shared business logic + view) and per-backend
entry modules (`Main.sky` for web, `MainTui.sky` for terminal).

`App.sky` — written once, runs on both:
```elm
module App exposing (Model, Msg, init, update, view, subscriptions)

import Std.Ui as Ui
import Std.Ui exposing (Element)
import Std.Ui.Font as Font

type alias Model = { count : Int }
type Msg = Increment | Decrement

init : () -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
init _ = ( { count = 0 }, Cmd.none )

update : Msg -> Model -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment -> ( { model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none )
        Decrement -> ( { model | count = model.count - 1 }, Cmd.none )

view : Model -> Element Msg
view model =
    Ui.column
        [ Ui.spacing 8, Ui.padding 16 ]
        [ Ui.el [ Font.bold, Font.size 24 ]
              (Ui.text ("Count: " ++ String.fromInt model.count))
        , Ui.row [ Ui.spacing 4 ]
            [ Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Decrement, label = Ui.text "−" }
            , Ui.button [] { onPress = Just Increment, label = Ui.text "+" }
            ]
        ]

subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions _ = Sub.none
```

`Main.sky` (web entry — `sky run` serves at localhost:8000):
```elm
module Main exposing (main)
import Std.Live as Live
import App
main =
    Live.app
        { init = App.init, update = App.update, view = App.view
        , subscriptions = App.subscriptions
        , routes = [ Live.route "/" () ], notFound = ()
        }
```

`MainTui.sky` (terminal entry — `sky run MainTui.sky` renders ANSI cells):
```elm
module MainTui exposing (main)
import Std.Tui as Tui
import App
main =
    Tui.app
        { init = App.init, update = App.update, view = App.view
        , subscriptions = App.subscriptions
        , onKey =
            \k -> if k.value == "+" then App.Increment
                  else if k.value == "-" then App.Decrement
                  else App.Increment
        }
        |> Task.run
```

Same Std.Ui widgets, same Msg dispatch, two completely different
outputs. The `view` function is portable because Std.Ui's `Element
msg` is backend-agnostic — Live renders to HTML, Tui renders to
ANSI cells via `runtime-go/rt/tui_ui.go`.

Limits of portability:
- Sky.Live-only: file uploads (`Event.onFile`), routing, session
  stores. Tui has no equivalents.
- Sky.Tui-only: keyboard event with modifiers, mouse press, scroll
  wheel. Live receives DOM events with different shapes.
- Where backends share: layout (row/column/grid/wrappedRow), text
  styling, borders, padding/spacing, inputs (text/checkbox/radio/
  slider), `onClick`/`onSubmit`/`onInput` events, focus management.

## Sky.Webview — Native desktop TEA (v0.1 MVP, macOS only)

Cross-backend mirror of `Live.app` + `Tui.app`. Opens a native
system webview window (WKWebView on macOS) and reuses the
Sky.Live HTML renderer + VNode diff so the same `view` function
paints unchanged. Bridge is in-process `Bind` + `Eval` — no HTTP,
no SSE, no session store.

```elm
import Std.Webview as Webview

main =
    Webview.app
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view                      -- view : Model -> Element msg
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , window = { title = "My App", size = ( 800, 600 ) }
        }
        |> Task.run
```

v0.1 is macOS only. Windows + Linux compile but smoke-validation
lands in v0.2 (along with tray icons, alwaysOnTop, transparent,
native file dialogs). Pick Sky.Webview for single-user desktop
apps that need a packaged binary; Sky.Live for anything
multi-tenant or with a public URL; Sky.Tui for headless / SSH /
CI terminals.

`WindowCfg = { title : String, size : (Int, Int) }` is a closed
record in v0.1 — missing fields surface as clean Sky TYPE ERROR
diagnostics. v0.2 will reopen the record for optional fields.

## Application Patterns — When to Use What

### 1. Simple CLI App

No `[live]` in sky.toml. Just `main` calling functions directly.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)
import Std.Log exposing (println)
import Sky.Core.Platform as Platform

main =
    let
        args = Platform.getArgs ()
    in
    case args of
        _ :: "add" :: title :: _ -> addItem title
        _ :: "list" :: _ -> listItems
        _ -> println "Usage: app [add|list]"
```

### 2. HTTP Server (non-Live, Go-style)

Uses gorilla/mux or net/http directly. Server renders HTML with `Std.Html.render`. Use `System.loadEnv` to load `.env` files for configuration.

```elm
import Net.Http as Http
import Github.Com.Gorilla.Mux as Mux
import Sky.Core.Process as Process exposing (getEnv, loadEnv)
import Sky.Core.Maybe as Maybe

main =
    let
        _ = loadEnv ""   -- load .env file
        port = Maybe.withDefault "8000" (getEnv "PORT")
    in
    -- Each FFI call returns Result; chain through Result.andThen
    -- so the first failure short-circuits the rest.
    Mux.newRouter ()
        |> Result.andThen (\r ->
            Mux.routerHandleFunc r "/" indexHandler
                |> Result.andThen (\_ -> Http.listenAndServe (":" ++ port) r))
        |> Result.withDefault ()

indexHandler w req =
    case Http.responseWriterHeader w of
        Ok header ->
            Http.headerSet header "Content-Type" "text/html"
                |> Result.andThen (\_ ->
                    Io.writeString w (render (div [] [ text "Hello" ])))
                |> Result.withDefault ()

        Err _ ->
            ()
```

### 3. Sky.Live App (Server-Driven UI with SSE)

Uses TEA architecture. Server holds state, pushes DOM diffs via SSE. Add `[live]` to sky.toml.

Use when: interactive web UIs, real-time dashboards, forms, admin panels.

### 4. Database App

Prefer `Std.Db` (ships with Sky) over raw `database/sql` FFI — it already
handles connection pooling, parameterised queries, identifier quoting, and
transactions.

```elm
import Std.Db as Db

-- Top-level: open once, memoised for the lifetime of the process.
openDb = Db.connect ()

main =
    case openDb of
        Err e -> println ("Database unavailable: " ++ Error.toString e)
        Ok db ->
            case Db.execRaw db "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ..." of
                Ok _  -> serve db
                Err e -> println ("Schema init failed: " ++ Error.toString e)
```

sky.toml:
```toml
[database]
driver = "sqlite"
path   = "app.db"

# OR
# url  = "postgres://user:pass@host/db?sslmode=disable"
```

---

## Real-World App Skeletons

Every skeleton in this section is a complete, working starting point. Copy
it into `src/Main.sky`, adjust the types, and `sky run`. Each one is tested
against the v0.9 Sky compiler.

### Recipe 1: Todo CRUD with Sky.Live

The canonical "interactive web app with database" flow. Covers: open DB
once at top level, Model holds only serialisable state, update handlers
reload from DB after mutations, VNode diff pushes changes via SSE.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)
import Sky.Core.List as List
import Sky.Core.String as String
import Sky.Core.Dict as Dict
import Sky.Core.Maybe as Maybe
import Sky.Core.Error as Error exposing (Error)
import Std.Html exposing (..)

    { id : String
    , title : String
    , done : Bool
    }

    { page : Page
    , todos : List Todo
    , draft : String
    , notice : String
    }

type Msg
    = AddTodo

    case Db.query db "SELECT id, title, done FROM todos ORDER BY id" [] of

    }

                      }
                    , Cmd.none
                    )


errorModel msg =
    { page = HomePage, todos = [], draft = "", notice = msg }


update msg model =
    case openDb of
        Err _ -> ( model, Cmd.none )
        Ok db -> updateWithDb db msg model


updateWithDb db msg model =

                    id = Result.withDefault "" (Uuid.newString)
                    _ =
                        Db.exec db
                            "INSERT INTO todos (id, title, done) VALUES (?, ?, 0)"
                            [ id, model.draft ]
                in
                    ( { model
                        | todos = getTodos db

                      }

                _ = Db.exec db "DELETE FROM todos WHERE id = ?" [id]
            in
                ( { model | todos = getTodos db }, Cmd.none )


view model =
    div [ class "app" ]
        [ h1 [] [ text "Todos" ]
        , form [ onSubmit AddTodo, class "row" ]
            [ input

        , if model.notice == "" then text "" else p [ class "notice" ] [ text model.notice ]
        ]

        [ input
            [ type_ "checkbox"

main =

        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        , subscriptions = \_ -> Sub.none
        , routes = [ route "/" HomePage ]
        , notFound = HomePage
        }
```

Key idioms demonstrated:
- DB connection at top level (`openDb = Db.connect ()`), not in Model.
- `update` wraps with `case openDb of` so handler code is always holding a
  live DB — no `Maybe Db` in Model.
- After any mutation, reload the relevant list (`todos = getTodos db`)
  rather than trying to patch the Model manually.
- Boolean attribute (`checked todo.done`) now correctly renders only when
  `True` (v0.9-dev fix).

entry = "src/Main.sky"

port = 3000

            viewAuthenticated sess model

        Nothing ->
            case model.page of

                SignUpPage -> viewSignUp model
                _ -> viewLanding model


viewLanding model =

sky.toml:
```toml
[auth]
method = "password"
secret = "change-me-to-a-32-byte-hex-string"
session_ttl = "24h"
email_verification = true
```

Key idioms:
- Session stored in Model as `Maybe Session` — NOT the bcrypt hash or raw
  credentials (those live only in Std.Auth's table).
- Pattern-match on `ErrorKind` (`PermissionDenied`, `InvalidInput`) to
  render specific UI copy while logging the real error message for ops.
- `signInPassword` / `signUpPassword` are cleared from the Model once the
  form is submitted — don't persist credentials across SSE patches.

### Recipe 3: LLM Chat App

Calls an external LLM API via `Http.request`, streams results into the UI
via `Cmd.perform`. Mirrors the sky-chat structure.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)
import Sky.Core.String as String
import Sky.Core.List as List
import Sky.Core.Task as Task
import Sky.Core.Http as Http

import Std.Cmd as Cmd
import Std.Sub as Sub


type Page = ChatPage

type alias ChatMessage =
    { role : String    -- "user" | "assistant" | "system"
    , content : String
    }

type alias Model =
    { page : Page
    , messages : List ChatMessage
    , draft : String
    , loading : Bool
    , error : String
    }

type Msg
    = DraftChanged String
    | SendMessage
    | AiResponseReceived (Result Error String)


init _ =
    ( { page = ChatPage
      , messages = []
      , draft = ""
      , loading = False
      , error = ""
      }
    , Cmd.none
    )


-- Zero-arity with `_` param — forces System.getenv to evaluate per call,
-- AFTER .env loads (Cardinal Rule 9).
apiKey _ = System.getenvOr "OPENAI_API_KEY" ""


callOpenAi : List ChatMessage -> Task Error String
callOpenAi history =
    let
        body =
            Encode.object
                [ ( "model", Encode.string "gpt-4o-mini" )
                , ( "messages", Encode.list encodeMessage history )
                , ( "max_tokens", Encode.int 1024 )

            { method = "POST"
            , url = "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions"
            , headers =
                [ ( "Authorization", "Bearer " ++ apiKey () )
                , ( "Content-Type", "application/json" )
                ]
            , body = Encode.encode 0 body
            }
            |> Task.andThen parseResponse


encodeMessage m =
    Encode.object
        [ ( "role", Encode.string m.role )
        , ( "content", Encode.string m.content )
        ]


parseResponse resp =
    if resp.status >= 400 then
        Task.fail (Error.network ("HTTP " ++ String.fromInt resp.status))

    else
        let
            decoder =
                Decode.field "choices"
                    (Decode.index 0
                        (Decode.field "message"
                            (Decode.field "content" Decode.string)))
        in
            case Decode.decodeString decoder resp.body of
                Ok content -> Task.succeed content
                Err e -> Task.fail (Error.decode (Error.toString e))


update msg model =
    case msg of
        DraftChanged v ->
            ( { model | draft = v }, Cmd.none )

        SendMessage ->
            if String.trim model.draft == "" || model.loading then
                ( model, Cmd.none )

            else
                let
                    userMsg = { role = "user", content = model.draft }
                    newHistory = model.messages ++ [ userMsg ]
                in
                    ( { model
                        | messages = newHistory
                        , draft = ""
                        , loading = True
                        , error = ""
                      }
                    , Cmd.perform (callOpenAi newHistory) AiResponseReceived
                    )

        AiResponseReceived (Ok content) ->
            let
                assistantMsg = { role = "assistant", content = content }
            in
                ( { model
                    | messages = model.messages ++ [ assistantMsg ]
                    , loading = False
                  }
                , Cmd.none
                )

        AiResponseReceived (Err e) ->
            ( { model | loading = False, error = Error.toString e }, Cmd.none )


view model =
    div [ class "chat" ]
        [ div [ class "messages" ] (List.map viewMessage model.messages)
        , viewComposer model
        , if model.error == "" then text "" else p [ class "err" ] [ text model.error ]
        ]


viewMessage m =
    div [ class ("msg " ++ m.role) ]
        [ text m.content ]


viewComposer model =
    form [ onSubmit SendMessage, class "composer" ]
        [ input
            [ type_ "text"
            , placeholder "Say something..."
            , value model.draft
            , onInput DraftChanged
            , disabled model.loading
            ]
            []
        , button
            [ type_ "submit"
            , disabled (model.loading || String.trim model.draft == "")
            ]
            [ text (if model.loading then "..." else "Send") ]
        ]


main =
    app
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        , subscriptions = \_ -> Sub.none
        , routes = [ route "/" ChatPage ]
        , notFound = ChatPage
        }
```

Key idioms:
- `Cmd.perform task toMsg` dispatches a background task and delivers its
  result as a Msg — UI stays responsive during the API call.
- `Http.request { ... }` takes a single record argument with
  `method`, `url`, `headers`, `body` fields.
- JSON decoder uses `Decode.index 0` to pull the first element from the
  `choices` array.
- `disabled` attributes honour their bool value: the input disables only
  while `loading`, the button disables when loading OR draft is empty.

### Recipe 4: Real-Time Dashboard (SSE subscriptions)

Pulls metrics every N seconds via `Time.every` and renders them live
without the user having to click anything.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)
import Sky.Core.String as String
import Sky.Core.List as List
import Sky.Core.Error as Error exposing (Error)
import Std.Html exposing (..)
import Std.Html.Attributes exposing (..)
import Std.Live exposing (app, route)
import Std.Cmd as Cmd
import Std.Sub as Sub
import Std.Time as Time
import Std.Db as Db


type Page = DashboardPage

type alias Metric = { name : String, value : Int, checkedAt : String }

type alias Model =
    { page : Page
    , metrics : List Metric
    , paused : Bool
    }

type Msg = Tick | TogglePause


openDb = Db.connect ()


loadMetrics db =
    case Db.query db "SELECT name, value, checked_at FROM metrics ORDER BY name" [] of
        Err _ -> []
        Ok rows -> List.map rowToMetric rows


rowToMetric row =
    { name = Db.getField "name" row
    , value = Db.getInt "value" row
    , checkedAt = Db.getField "checked_at" row
    }


init _ =
    case openDb of
        Err _ -> ( { page = DashboardPage, metrics = [], paused = False }, Cmd.none )
        Ok db -> ( { page = DashboardPage, metrics = loadMetrics db, paused = False }, Cmd.none )


update msg model =
    case msg of
        TogglePause ->
            ( { model | paused = not model.paused }, Cmd.none )

        Tick ->
            case openDb of
                Err _ -> ( model, Cmd.none )
                Ok db -> ( { model | metrics = loadMetrics db }, Cmd.none )


subscriptions model =
    if model.paused then
        Sub.none

    else
        Time.every 5000 Tick   -- fire Tick every 5s via SSE


view model =
    div [ class "dash" ]
        [ h1 [] [ text "Dashboard" ]
        , button [ onClick TogglePause ] [ text (if model.paused then "Resume" else "Pause") ]
        , ul [] (List.map viewMetric model.metrics)
        ]


viewMetric m =
    li []
        [ strong [] [ text m.name ]
        , text (": " ++ String.fromInt m.value ++ " (" ++ m.checkedAt ++ ")")
        ]


main =
    app
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes = [ route "/" DashboardPage ]
        , notFound = DashboardPage
        }
```

Key idioms:
- Subscriptions are CONDITIONAL — turn `Time.every` off when the user
  pauses. Returning `Sub.none` cancels the timer.
- `Tick` handler reloads the whole list, not incremental diffs. The
  VNode diff + SSE patch path sends only the changed rows to the client.

### Recipe 5: JSON API Server (Sky.Http.Server, no TEA)

For REST endpoints you don't need TEA — use `Sky.Http.Server` directly.

```elm
module Main exposing (main)

import Sky.Core.Prelude exposing (..)
import Sky.Core.Task as Task
import Sky.Core.Json.Encode as Encode
import Sky.Core.Json.Decode as Decode
import Sky.Core.Error as Error exposing (Error)
import Sky.Http.Server as Server


type alias User = { id : Int, name : String, email : String }


getUser : Server.Request -> Task Error Server.Response
getUser req =
    let
        id = Server.param "id" req |> Maybe.withDefault "0" |> String.toInt |> Result.withDefault 0
        user = { id = id, name = "Demo", email = "demo@example.com" }

        json =
            Encode.object
                [ ( "id", Encode.int user.id )
                , ( "name", Encode.string user.name )
                , ( "email", Encode.string user.email )
                ]
    in
        Task.succeed (Server.json (Encode.encode 2 json))


health _ = Task.succeed (Server.text "ok")


main =
    Server.listen 8000
        [ Server.get "/health" health
        , Server.get "/api/users/:id" getUser
        ]
```

Use when: you need a classic JSON API with routing and no server-driven UI.

sky install                        # install all from sky.toml
```

This auto-generates `.skycache/go/<package>/bindings.skyi` with type-safe Sky bindings and `sky_wrappers/<package>.go` with Go wrapper functions (including panic recovery). **Never write FFI code manually** — the compiler generates everything. The inspector extracts ALL struct fields, methods, functions, and constants. Dead code elimination strips unused wrappers from the final build.

`sky install` auto-scans your source files for FFI imports and generates any missing bindings. The inspector runs in **multi-mode** (one `packages.Load` over all missing deps) so shared transitive deps are type-checked once across the whole batch. Inspector calls run in **bounded-parallel chunks** (`SKY_INSTALL_PARALLEL` env var, default `min(numProcessors, 4)`) so multi-pkg installs scale with your CPU. For projects with extensive Go FFI (Stripe SDK, Firebase, Firestore, …) this typically halves total install time vs the per-pkg sequential path. Skyshop's 18-dep install drops from ~67s to ~58s on an M1; the floor is whatever the slowest single package takes (Stripe master is ~53s — Tier 2's usage-driven FFI generation is the answer when that becomes the wall).

### Import Path Mapping

Go package paths map to PascalCase Sky module names. **The Sky kernel
already covers the common cases — only reach for the Go FFI binding
when you need a Go-only API the kernel doesn't surface.** For example,
`Crypto.sha256 s` (kernel) returns the hex digest directly; you only
need `import Crypto.Sha256 as Sha256` if you want raw bytes for
further processing.

| Go Package | Sky Import | Notes |
|-----------|-----------|-------|
| `net/http` | `import Net.Http as Http` | for HTTP client beyond `Sky.Core.Http`'s `get`/`post`/`request` |
| `database/sql` | `import Database.Sql as Sql` | for raw `sql.DB` access; `Std.Db` covers most usage |
| `crypto/sha256` | `import Crypto.Sha256 as Sha256` | kernel `Crypto.sha256 s` returns hex string directly — use this for plain hashing |
| `encoding/hex` | `import Encoding.Hex as Hex` | kernel `Encoding.hexEncode s` / `Encoding.hexDecode s` cover string ↔ hex |
| `os` | `import Os` | Go's process-state package (stdin/stderr/file ops). Sky kernel is `System.*` (no collision since v0.10.0) |
| `os/exec` | `import Os.Exec as Exec` | for richer subprocess control than `Process.run` |
| `log/slog` | `import Log.Slog as Slog` | Go's structured logger. Sky kernel `Log.*With` is the preferred surface |
| `bufio` | `import Bufio` | line/byte scanning, e.g. for stdin pipelines |
| `io` | `import Io` | low-level Reader/Writer; kernel `Sky.Core.Io` covers stdin/stdout/stderr |
| `github.com/google/uuid` | `import Github.Com.Google.Uuid as Uuid` |
| `github.com/gorilla/mux` | `import Github.Com.Gorilla.Mux as Mux` |
| `modernc.org/sqlite` | `import Modernc.Org.Sqlite as _` |
| `fyne.io/fyne/v2` | `import Fyne.Io.Fyne.V2 as Fyne` |
| `github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v84` | `import Github.Com.Stripe.StripeGo.V84 as Stripe` |
| `github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v84/checkout/session` | `import Github.Com.Stripe.StripeGo.V84.Checkout.Session as Session` |

### Calling Conventions

Every FFI call returns `Result Error T`. Pattern-match or chain via
`Result.andThen` / `Result.withDefault` at every call site.

```elm
-- Zero-arg Go functions/variables: no () in Sky (returns Result)
case Uuid.newString of
    Ok id -> useId id
    Err e -> handleError e

-- Or with Result.withDefault for "bail to a default"
id = Result.withDefault "anonymous" Uuid.newString

-- Go methods: first arg is receiver. Returns Result.
case Mux.routerHandleFunc router "/path" handler of
    Ok _ -> ...
    Err e -> ...

-- Go struct fields: accessor function returns Result
case Http.requestUrl req of
    Ok url -> ...
    Err e -> ...

-- Go constants: accessed as values (still Result-wrapped)
status = Result.withDefault 200 Http.statusOK

-- Go package variables: getter + setter (both Result)
key = Result.withDefault "" (Stripe.key ())
case Stripe.setKey "sk_test_..." of
    Ok _ -> ...
    Err e -> ...

-- Go struct construction: chain setters via Result.andThen
-- Each setter returns Result Error TypeName.
result =
    Stripe.newCheckoutSessionParams ()
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetMode "payment")
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionParamsSetCustomer id)

-- Nested structs: build inner first, then set on outer
priceDataResult =
    Stripe.newCheckoutSessionLineItemPriceDataParams ()
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionLineItemPriceDataParamsSetCurrency "gbp")
        |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionLineItemPriceDataParamsSetUnitAmount 1000)

lineItemResult =
    priceDataResult
        |> Result.andThen (\priceData ->
            Stripe.newCheckoutSessionLineItemParams ()
                |> Result.andThen (Stripe.checkoutSessionLineItemParamsSetPriceData priceData))
```

**Why all the Results?** The FFI boundary can fail in ways Sky's
type system can't see (Go panics, nil pointers, missing config,
goroutine leaks). Every wrapper catches these via panic recovery
and returns `Err(ErrFfi(...))` instead of crashing. See
`docs/ffi/boundary-philosophy.md` for the full reasoning. **Prefer
Sky's stdlib** (`Std.Crypto`, `Std.Time`, `Std.Http`, etc.) where
available — those don't pay the Result tax for genuinely-pure ops.

**Important**: Never pass Sky records `{ field = value }` as Go struct parameters. Always use the `newTypeName ()` constructor + `typeNameSetField value` setters. Sky records are `map[string]any` at runtime; Go functions expect typed struct pointers.

### Side-Effect Imports (Database Drivers)

Some Go packages are drivers that register themselves via `init()`. Import with `_`:

```elm
import Modernc.Org.Sqlite as _    -- registers "sqlite" driver for database/sql
```

### Handler Functions (HTTP)

Go HTTP handlers take `(http.ResponseWriter, *http.Request)`. Each
FFI call is a Result; chain via `Result.andThen` and let the first
`Err` short-circuit:

```elm
handler : ResponseWriter -> Request -> Unit
handler w req =
    Http.responseWriterHeader w
        |> Result.andThen (\header -> Http.headerSet header "Content-Type" "text/html")
        |> Result.andThen (\_ -> Io.writeString w "Hello")
        |> Result.withDefault ()

-- Cookie management
token =
    case Http.requestCookie req "session" of
        Ok cookie ->
            Result.withDefault "" (Http.cookieValue cookie)
        Err _ ->
            ""

-- Form values
email = Result.withDefault "" (Http.requestFormValue req "email")

-- Redirect
Http.redirect w req "/login" 302
```

Sky.Live config is embedded at compile time but can be overridden at runtime. Env vars and the corresponding `sky.toml` keys (under the single `[live]` table — there is NO `[live.session]` section):

| Env var | sky.toml `[live]` key | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `SKY_LIVE_PORT` | `port` | Server port (default 8000) |
| `SKY_LIVE_INPUT` | `input` | `debounce` or `blur` |
| `SKY_LIVE_POLL_INTERVAL` | `poll_interval` | ms (0 = SSE only) |
| `SKY_LIVE_STORE` | `store` | Session store: `memory` (default), `sqlite`, `redis` / `valkey`, `postgres` |
| `SKY_LIVE_STORE_PATH` | `storePath` | sqlite file path, or redis `host:port` / `redis://…`, or postgres URL |
| `DATABASE_URL` | -- | Postgres URL fallback if `SKY_LIVE_STORE_PATH` is unset |
| `REDIS_URL` | -- | Redis URL fallback if `SKY_LIVE_STORE_PATH` is unset (defaults to `localhost:6379`) |
| `SKY_LIVE_STATIC_DIR` | `static` | Path to static assets |
| `SKY_LIVE_TTL` | `ttl` | Session TTL (Go duration format, e.g. `30m`) |
| `SKY_LIVE_MAX_BODY_BYTES` | `maxBodyBytes` | Cap for `/_sky/event` POST body (default `5242880` = 5 MiB; bump for `Event.onFile` / `Event.onImage` uploads larger than 5 MiB) |

Connection-status banner (v0.9.9+, hardened against proxy wedges in v0.11.x post-release): `SKY_LIVE_BANNER` (default `on`; `off` / `0` / `false` to suppress the chrome but keep the retry queue active), `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_BASE_MS` (default `500`), `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_MAX_MS` (default `16000`), `SKY_LIVE_RETRY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (default `10`), `SKY_LIVE_QUEUE_MAX` (default `50`), `SKY_LIVE_HELLO_TIMEOUT_MS` (default `8000` — how long the client waits for the server's SSE handshake before treating the connection as proxy-wedged and force-reopening), `SKY_LIVE_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS` (default `35000` — max idle time on the SSE before the client treats the stream as silently dropped; sized for 2× the server's 15 s heartbeat), `SKY_LIVE_SSE_BUFFER` (default `16`, clamped to `[1, 1024]` — capacity of the per-session SSE frame buffer between producers (`dispatchBatched` / `runPerformBody` / `Time.every` tick) and the SSE consumer. Drops when full surface as the Prometheus counter `sky_live_sse_drops_total{session=<sid>}` at `/_sky/metrics`).

**Connection status banner**: the runtime injects a bottom-pinned banner that shows `Reconnecting…` (amber) when the SSE connection drops or a POST `/_sky/event` fails, and `Connection lost — refresh to retry` (red) after the retry attempts are exhausted. POST failures during the outage land in a FIFO queue; the SSE re-open or a successful retry drains them, so clicks during a brief outage replay automatically. Use a persistent session store (Redis / Postgres / SQLite / Firestore) for production deployments — the memory store loses Model state on every server restart, so reconnect re-initialises from `init`. After reaching the offline state the runtime keeps trying SSE in the background at the max delay, so a healed network recovers without a refresh. The banner is opt-out via `SKY_LIVE_BANNER=off`; styling can be overridden by `#__sky-status { ... !important }` in the user's stylesheet.

**Reverse-proxy hardening**: a misbehaving edge (Cloudflare, fly.io, custom Nginx) that rewrites an upstream 502 into a 200 OK with a non-SSE body would previously wedge the client at `Reconnecting…` even after the server itself recovered. The runtime now sends `X-Accel-Buffering: no`, a 2 KB padding line, an immediate `event: hello\ndata: {"v":1,"sid":...}\n\n` handshake, and a `event: heartbeat` every 15 s on `/_sky/sse`. Every `/_sky/event` POST response carries `X-Sky-Live: 1`. The client only flips to `connected` on the hello event, and a 5 s watchdog tears down + reopens the stream when no hello arrives within `SKY_LIVE_HELLO_TIMEOUT_MS` or no heartbeat within `SKY_LIVE_HEARTBEAT_TTL_MS`. POST responses without `X-Sky-Live: 1` are treated as wedged and never applied as patches (with a backwards-compat shim for structurally-valid JSON during rolling deploys).

**Localising the banner text** (i18n): override the two user-facing strings via the `status` field on `Live.app`:

```elm
main =
    Live.app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view, subscriptions = subscriptions
        , routes = [ Live.route "/" HomePage ], notFound = HomePage
        , status =
            { reconnecting = "Reconnexion…"
            , offline = "Connexion perdue — actualisez la page"
            }
        }
```

No type signature change is needed — `Live.app`'s record is open via the kernel's `appExt` extension. Either field is optional — partial overrides fall back to the English defaults (`"Reconnecting…"` / `"Connection lost — refresh to retry"`). Strings are JSON-encoded into the JS template (newlines, quotes, non-ASCII, emoji round-trip safely) and rendered via DOM `textContent`, never `innerHTML`, so user content can't break out of the banner.

**Input preservation across re-renders** (v0.11.x post-release): three failure modes were closing in on production apps and have been fixed:

1. **Empty patches → JSON ack, not HTML fallback.** When input-authority alignment correctly drops every diff (model advanced but client already has the typed value), `dispatchRoot` used to misclassify the empty patch list as "diff failed → send full HTML". The HTML fallback recreated every input — blanking uncontrolled fields like password. Now empty patches send an empty JSON envelope (with seq + ackInputs) so the DOM stays untouched.
2. **Full-body swap preserves every uncontrolled input, not just the focused one.** `__skyReplaceHTMLPreservingFocus` now walks every `INPUT` / `TEXTAREA` / `SELECT` in the live container and splices any whose server-side placeholder is uncontrolled (no `value` / `checked` / `selected` attr). The previously-special focused-input path is unified into the same loop.
3. **Open `<select>` defence.** Native dropdowns close on any DOM mutation in their subtree. While the user has a SELECT focused, `__skyApplyPatches` and the SSE patch handler skip patches that touch the SELECT or any element that contains it (or is contained by it). The next user interaction (option click, blur) triggers reconciliation. Active user paths (sky-nav, popstate, POST text fallback) are deliberately NOT defended — dropping them would freeze navigation.

**Priority (highest wins):** system env vars > `.env` file > `sky.toml` defaults. System env vars always win so production deployments can override without editing files. `.env` is for local dev convenience.

### Importing Sky Dependencies

Three import syntaxes are supported for `.skydeps/` packages (all resolve to the same file):

```elm
-- Stripped (cleanest, recommended)
import Tailwind as Tw

-- Prefixed (PascalCase package name + module)
import SkyTailwind.Tailwind as Tw

-- Full path (mirrors the dependency URL)
import Github.Com.Anzellai.SkyTailwind.Tailwind as Tw
```

Resolution precedence: local `src/` > `.skydeps/` > stdlib. Local modules shadow dependencies; use full/prefixed path to disambiguate. Only modules listed in the package's `[lib].exposing` are importable.

## Std.Db — Database Abstraction

> User-facing overview (with worked CRUD + transaction examples) at [docs/skydb/overview.md](https://github.com/anzellai/sky/blob/main/docs/skydb/overview.md).

```elm
import Std.Db as Db
import Modernc.Org.Sqlite as _   -- driver import needed for SQLite

-- Open connection
db = Db.connect ()  -- reads [database] from sky.toml
    Ok conn -> ...
    Err e -> ...

-- Parameterised queries (injection-safe)
Db.exec conn "INSERT INTO t (name) VALUES (?)" ["val"]
Db.query conn "SELECT * FROM t WHERE x = ?" ["val"]
Db.execRaw conn "CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS t (...)"

-- v0.16.26: mixed-type SQL params via typed SqlValue ADT.
-- `[SqlString name, SqlInt age, SqlBool active, fromMaybeInt qty,
--   SqlMoney price]` is a homogeneous `List SqlValue` that
-- type-checks cleanly and binds each variant to the right
-- database/sql type. Avoids the no-Workaround stringify trap.
-- Variants: SqlString | SqlInt | SqlFloat | SqlBool | SqlBytes |
-- SqlDecimal | SqlTime | SqlMoney | SqlNull SqlValue (recursive
-- with type-witness). Maybe-lifting helpers: `fromMaybeString` ..
-- `fromMaybeMoney`. PATCH-style partial update via Db.updateFields
-- + DEFAULT-omittable INSERT via Db.insertFields (#585) — both take
-- SqlField (SetField | OmitField); insertFields all-omit emits
-- `INSERT … DEFAULT VALUES`. v0.16.30 `Db.insertFieldsReturning`
-- (#586) appends `RETURNING <projection>` to the same builder and
-- decodes each returned row via `Std.Db.Decode` — pick up assigned
-- autoincrement ids / applied DEFAULTs at INSERT time (SQLite ≥
-- 3.35 / PostgreSQL). Money round-trips via "ISO_CODE AMOUNT" TEXT
-- — pair with `Db.Decode.money`.
import Std.Db exposing (SqlValue(..), SqlField(..))
Db.exec conn
    "INSERT INTO items (name, qty, price) VALUES (?, ?, ?)"
    [ SqlString name, fromMaybeInt qty, SqlMoney price ]

-- Typed queries via Std.Db.Decode (v0.15.45 — preferred over the
-- Dict.get accessor boilerplate). Mirrors Sky.Core.Json.Decode's
-- shape (string/int/float/bool/money/nullable/map/map2-5/andMap/
-- required/optional). v0.16.24: nullable is single-arg
-- (`nullable (int "age")`, not `nullable "age" (int "age")`).
-- v0.16.24: Db.exec/query bind `Maybe a` directly — `Just v`
-- writes the value, `Nothing` writes SQL NULL. Decoder/Db/Value/
-- Attribute/Handler/Cmd/Sub/Request/Response/Error are kernel-
-- implicit Prelude types — always in scope, no import needed.
import Std.Db.Decode as DbDecode

userDecoder : Decoder User
userDecoder =
    DbDecode.succeed (\i n e -> { id = i, name = n, email = e })
        |> DbDecode.andMap (DbDecode.int "id")
        |> DbDecode.andMap (DbDecode.string "name")
        |> DbDecode.andMap (DbDecode.string "email")
-- For nullable columns: `DbDecode.nullable (DbDecode.int "age")` —
-- single-arg form (v0.16.24+). Inner is required to be a typed
-- decoder for the column.

users : Task Error (List User)
users = Db.queryDecode db "SELECT id, name, email FROM users" [] userDecoder

userById : Int -> Task Error (Maybe User)
userById uid =
    Db.getByIdDecode db "users" uid userDecoder

-- Convenience
Db.insertRow conn "table" (Dict.fromList [("col", "val")])
Db.getById conn "table" "123"
Db.updateById conn "table" "123" (Dict.fromList [("col", "new")])
Db.deleteById conn "table" "123"
Db.findWhere conn "table" "column" "value"

-- Row helpers (for untyped Dict queries)
Db.getField "name" row   -- String
Db.getInt "count" row     -- Int
Db.getBool "done" row     -- Bool

-- Transactions
Db.withTransaction conn (\tx ->
    let _ = Db.txExec tx "..." []
    in Ok ()
)
```

## Std.Auth — Authentication

> User-facing overview (with register / login / protected-route walkthrough + production checklist) at [docs/skyauth/overview.md](https://github.com/anzellai/sky/blob/main/docs/skyauth/overview.md).

```elm
import Std.Auth as Auth

-- Register (auto-creates sky_users + sky_sessions tables)
Auth.register "alice@example.com" "password123"
-- Ok { id, email, role, verified }

-- Login (returns session token + user)
Auth.login "alice@example.com" "password123"
-- Ok { token, user: { id, email, role, name, avatarUrl, verified } }

-- Verify session token
Auth.verify sessionToken
-- Ok { id, email, role, ... }

-- Logout
Auth.logout sessionToken

-- Email verification (when email_verification = true in sky.toml)
Auth.verifyEmail verificationToken

-- Low-level: bcrypt hash/verify
Auth.hashPassword "password"        -- Ok "bcrypt-hash"
Auth.verifyPassword "pw" "hash"     -- True/False
Auth.setRole userId "admin"
Auth.signToken "payload"            -- Ok "hmac-signature"
```

Configure in sky.toml:
```toml
[auth]
method = "password"
secret = "your-secret-key"          # required
previous_secrets = "old-key-1"      # optional: for key rotation
bcrypt_cost = 12                    # optional (default 12)
session_ttl = "24h"                 # optional (default 24h)
email_verification = false          # optional (default false)
```

Env var overrides: `SKY_AUTH_SECRET`, `SKY_AUTH_PREVIOUS_SECRETS`, `SKY_AUTH_METHOD`, `SKY_AUTH_BCRYPT_COST`, `SKY_AUTH_SESSION_TTL`, `SKY_AUTH_EMAIL_VERIFICATION`.

Key rotation: move current `secret` to `previous_secrets`, set new `secret`, restart. `signToken` uses current key; `verifyToken` checks current + previous keys.

When `email_verification = true`, `Auth.register` returns a `verificationToken`. Your app delivers it:
```elm
case Auth.register email password of
    Ok user ->
        case Dict.get "verificationToken" user of
            Just token -> sendVerificationEmail email token  -- your email provider
            Nothing -> ...
```

For apps with custom user fields (username, avatar), use `Auth.hashPassword`/`Auth.verifyPassword` for the crypto while keeping your own users table.

## Going to production — config cheatsheet

Two sources of truth: `sky.toml` (compiled defaults, in repo) and the process environment (deploy-time secrets + per-env overrides). Precedence: **process env > `.env` file > `sky.toml`**. `.env` is auto-loaded at startup but never overrides existing env vars, so `docker run -e ENV=production` always wins.

### Minimum production-ready `sky.toml`

```toml
name    = "myapp"
version = "0.1.0"
entry   = "src/Main.sky"

[source]
root = "src"

[live]
port         = 8000
store        = "postgres"
ttl          = "24h"
maxBodyBytes = 5242880          # 5 MiB POST cap; bump for file uploads

[log]
format = "json"                 # plain | json — pick json for prod stdout aggregators
level  = "info"

[auth]
tokenTtl = "24h"
cookie   = "sky_sid"
# NEVER put tokenSecret in sky.toml — set SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET in env.
```

### Production `.env` template

```dotenv

### What flips between dev and prod

`productionFromEnv()` in `runtime-go/rt/observability.go` is the **one** function that drives all dev-only behaviour. It reads `ENV` (then `SKY_ENV`):

| `ENV` value | Mode | Console mount | `🔍 Console` banner | `/_sky/metrics` auth |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| unset / `dev` / `development` / `local` | dev | ✓ at `/_sky/console` | ✓ floating link | open (any read) |
| `production` / `prod` / `staging` / `qa` / `preview` / anything else | prod | hidden | hidden | `Authorization: Bearer $SKY_ADMIN_TOKEN` |

Bias-to-gate: if you bother to set `ENV` at all, you mean it's not dev.

### Sub-app mount (multi-binary deployments)

```go
// In the generated main.go of your PARENT app, after the mux is built:
import "your-app/rt"

rt.MountSubApp(mux, "/billing", rt.SpawnBinary("./billing-app"))
rt.MountSubApp(mux, "/admin",   rt.SpawnBinary("./admin-app"))
```

Each child is its own process — own session store, own update loop, no shared state. Sub-app logs / metrics / spans push to the parent's `/_sky/observability/ingest` labelled `subapp=<namespace>` (derived from the URL prefix). One Prometheus scrape on `/_sky/metrics` covers the whole tree.

A Sky-side ergonomic API (`Live.app { subApps = [...] }`) is on the v0.14 list; the Go-side API is the contract.

### Deployment platform notes

| Platform | What it gives you | What you set |
|---|---|---|
| Fly.io / Render / Railway | `PORT`, `DATABASE_URL`, secret manager | `ENV=production`, `SKY_AUTH_TOKEN_SECRET`, `SKY_ADMIN_TOKEN` |
| Cloud Run | `PORT`, secret manager | same + map `PORT` → `SKY_LIVE_PORT` if your code reads SKY_LIVE_PORT explicitly |
| Kubernetes | ConfigMap + Secret + Service | mount `/_sky/healthz` as liveness probe, `/_sky/readyz` as readiness probe |
| Docker compose | env_file: `.env.production` | same |

The single static binary works the same on all of them. Health probes hit `/_sky/healthz` (always 200) and `/_sky/readyz` (200 once the session store responds + dep services connected).

## Troubleshooting Cookbook

Error-message → root cause → fix. This is the single-file reference for
"my code won't compile / my app crashed at runtime". Check here before
spelunking through the runtime or compiler source.

### Compile errors (`sky build` / `sky check`)

**`TYPE ERROR: Type mismatch: ( { ... }, Cmd Msg ) vs ( Model, Cmd Msg ) (from: a vs ( Model, Cmd Msg ))`**

Your `init` or `update` returns an anonymous record literal, and HM can't
unify it with the `Model` alias. Usually means:

- A field name is misspelled (`tokensUsed` vs `tokenUsed`).
- A field has the wrong type (`Nothing` vs `Just 0` when the alias says `Int`).
- `db : Maybe Db.Db` is in the Model and you're on an old Sky binary — run
  `sky upgrade`.

Make the expectation explicit by annotating:
`init : a -> ( Model, Cmd Msg )`. The error will then pinpoint which field
differs.

**`Type mismatch: Int vs ()` at a function call**

Annotation promises one return type, body returns another. Common cause:
`initSchema : Db -> Result Error ()` over a body that's just `Db.execRaw ...`
— `execRaw` returns `Result Error Int`. Fix either the annotation or map
the body: `|> Result.map (\_ -> ())`.

**`Import error: module M does not expose X`**

Either the symbol isn't exported from `M`, or `M` hasn't generated an
interface file yet. Run `sky install` to regenerate FFI bindings. For Sky
modules, check the module's `module X exposing (..)` line.

**`DeclarationError <line> <col>` during parsing**

Parser got confused by a lambda / record layout at a tight column. Most
often: a multi-line lambda inside `List.map` that starts with an open
paren. Hoist the lambda to a top-level function, or fit the whole lambda
on ONE line. Annotations do not affect this — it's a pure parser issue.

**`Names resolved` but then no further output and a non-zero exit**

Canonicaliser failed silently — usually a name you used isn't in scope.
Add `-v` style logging isn't available; easiest fix is to bisect your
imports (comment half, re-run, narrow).

### Runtime panics

**`interface conversion: interface {} is X, not Y`**

Somewhere the typed runtime got an X but expected a Y. Common culprits:

- `int` vs `struct{}` — wrong annotation (Cardinal Rule 2).
- `rt.HttpResponse` vs `rt.SkyResponse` — usually a stale build; run
  `sky clean && sky build` (v0.9 fixed the mapping).
- `string` vs `[]map[string]string` — `rt.Concat` fell through to
  string-concat on typed slices (fixed v0.9-dev — `sky upgrade`).

**`rt.Coerce: expected []main.T_R, got string`**

`++` on a list produced a stringified blob because Concat didn't recognise
the typed slice. Fixed v0.9-dev — upgrade.

**`assignment to entry in nil map` inside `renderVNode`**

A form with `onSubmit`/`onClick` is being rendered through
`Html_render` with a nil handler map. Fixed v0.9-dev — upgrade.

**`reflect.Value.Call: call of nil function`**

A curried lambda passed to a Go-typed callback slot got its inner function
zero'd. Fixed v0.9-dev — upgrade.

**`stack overflow` in `walkGob` at server startup**

Your Model stores an opaque FFI handle (DB connection, HTTP client,
Firestore client) with internal pointer cycles. Fix: move the handle to a
top-level value, not in Model (Cardinal Rule 4).

**`Invalid email or password` on every sign-in even though the user exists**

`Db.getField` was reading from a `map[string]any` instead of the typed
`map[string]string` HM narrowed it to. Fixed v0.9-dev — upgrade.

**`No notes yet` / empty list rendered after a successful insert**

The record-update path silently dropped the `[]any → []T` widening.
Fixed v0.9-dev — upgrade.

**Chat input / button renders as permanently disabled**

Boolean HTML attrs (`disabled`, `checked`, etc.) always emitted regardless
of their value. Fixed v0.9-dev — upgrade.

**`session not found` on every event**

Either the client sent the wrong `sessionId`, or the server just restarted
and the memory store lost its sessions. For production, use a persistent
store:

```toml
[live]
store = "sqlite"
storePath = "sessions.db"
```

**`stack overflow` when subscribing to Time.every + handler does expensive work**

A Tick handler that triggers another Tick (via Cmd.perform + a Msg that
triggers the subscription's model) can loop. Add a `paused` flag or check
the model before firing.

### Deployment & production issues

**`OPENAI_API_KEY not set` but `.env` has it**

A zero-arity function reading `System.getenv` evaluated at Go `init()` time,
before `godotenv` ran. Add a dummy `_` parameter (Cardinal Rule 9).

**`sky-out/go.mod` got wiped after `sky run`**

Fixed v0.9-dev — incremental builds now re-seed Go deps. Upgrade.

**CSS not applying in Sky.Live app**

Make sure you call `styleNode [] (stylesheet [...])` at the TOP of your
view, not inside the body. The diff protocol needs the `<style>` block
to be a top-level VNode to stay stable across renders.

### Performance issues

**First request hangs for 5-30s**

Sky.Live does index-building on first request for the session store. If
using SQLite: set `busy_timeout` in your schema init. If using Postgres:
make sure `prepare_threshold` is sensible.

**Memory usage climbing linearly in a long-running app**

Session store memory grows with inactive sessions. Set a TTL:
`SKY_LIVE_TTL=30m`. For high-traffic apps, switch to SQLite or Redis.

## Known Limitations (v0.15)

Active limitations users still hit at HEAD. Anything not on this list
was either never a limitation or has been fixed; the repo `CHANGELOG.md`
records the per-version closures if you want history.

- **Anonymous records in function signatures (parser-side)** — the
  parser accepts `f : { name : String, age : Int } -> String` cleanly;
  what previously broke was a separate multi-line-sig issue (see
  "Multi-line function signatures" below). If you want to share a
  record shape across functions, a `type alias` is still preferable.
- **No higher-kinded types** — no `Functor`, `Monad`, etc. Use concrete types.
- **No `where` clauses** — use `let...in` instead.
- **No custom operators** — only built-in (`|>`, `<|`, `++`, `::`, etc.).
- **No row-polymorphic annotation syntax** — Sky doesn't parse `{ r | field : T }` in annotations. Use a closed record alias for the function's input.
- **Negative literal arguments need parentheses** — `f (-1)` not `f -1` (`f -1` parses as subtraction).
- **`Dict.toList` typed-key inference is inline-only** — `Dict.toList (Dict.fromList [(1, "a")])` chained in the same expression returns real `Int` keys (v0.15.45 closed the soundness hole for this shape via the typed-key `rt.Dict_toListIntKey` / `rt.Dict_toListFloatKey` runtime routes). For let-bound intermediates — `let d = Dict.fromList […] in Dict.toList d` — the solver doesn't expose `d`'s typed shape at the use-site, so routing falls back to the legacy String-key path. Workaround: inline the chain directly.
- **`sky check` doesn't fully model Go interfaces** — concrete types can't unify with Go interfaces (`Fyne.CanvasObject`), but the code compiles and runs fine.
- **Zero-arg calls follow the binding's declared type** — bare `Uuid.v4` works because its stdlib sig is `v4 : String`; `Time.now ()` / `Time.unixMillis ()` / `FyneApp.new ()` are *all* needed because their sigs are `() -> Task Error a`. Calling a `: String` binding with `()` triggers a known codegen bug for arity-0 kernels — stick to the declared shape.
- **FFI setters in pipelines need an explicit lambda** — `|> Result.andThen (OpenAi.chatCompletionMessageSetRole m.role)` emits a call to the non-existent non-T variant and fails codegen. Wrap: `|> Result.andThen (\msg -> OpenAi.chatCompletionMessageSetRole m.role msg)`.
- **Zero-arg `Css.*` constants DO need `()`** — `Css.zero ()`, `Css.auto ()`, `Css.none ()`, `Css.transparent ()`, `Css.inherit ()`, `Css.initial ()`, `Css.borderBox ()`, `Css.systemFont ()`, `Css.monoFont ()`, `Css.userSelectNone ()`. Bare form is now a clean type error (no longer the silent function-pointer leak it used to be), but the `()` is still required. Pattern: any `Css.X` that names a literal CSS keyword takes `()`; value constructors like `px`, `rem`, `em`, `hex`, `rgba` take their arguments directly.
- ~~**Recursive list ops grew the Go stack O(N).**~~ — CLOSED in v0.17 (Limitation #8, 13/13 list ops on constant Go stack). `map`, `filter`, `foldr`, `length`, `concat`, `concatMap`, `take`, `append`, `range`, `zip`, `indexedMap`, `Maybe.combine`, `Result.combine` all rewritten to CPS / accumulator form alongside the auto-TCO'd `foldl` / `find` / `any` / `all` / `member` / `drop`. 1M+ element lists no longer risk stack overflow on these primitives.
- **Multi-line function signatures with continuation INSIDE the type body** — `name\n    : T` (the `:` on a continuation line) parses cleanly. Continuation INSIDE the type body (`T1\n    -> T2`) is not supported — extract a `type alias` for the whole arrow type.
For closures (parametric record aliases, polymorphic
re-instantiation, panic-class hardening, head-alias unfolding, etc.)
the canonical reference is `docs/KNOWN_LIMITATIONS.md` in the Sky
repo + `git log`.  Anything not on the active list above is fixed.

## Coding Conventions

- **Module names** are PascalCase, match file paths: `Lib.Utils` → `src/Lib/Utils.sky`
- **No semicolons**, no curly braces — indentation-sensitive (same surface convention as Elm / Haskell)
- Use **`Std.Css`** for styling (not inline style strings)
- Use **`errorToString`** to convert Go errors to strings
- Pattern match on **`Result`** (`Ok val` / `Err e`) for Go functions returning errors
- Pattern match on **`Maybe`** (`Just val` / `Nothing`) for Go `*primitive` pointer returns
- **Nested patterns work**: `Ok (Just x)` and `Ok Nothing` are fully supported in case expressions
- **Import conventions**: Use `exposing (..)` sparingly — when two modules export the same name (e.g., `Std.Html` and `Tailwind` both export `hidden`, `h2`, etc.), the first import wins. Prefer qualified imports (`import Foo as F`) to avoid collisions. If using `Tailwind exposing (..)` alongside `Std.Html exposing (..)`, use `hidden_` (with underscore) for the Tailwind version, and `headerNode`/`footerNode` for HTML5 semantic elements
- **`exposing (Type(..))` limitation**: `import MyModule exposing (MyType(..))` does NOT expose ADT constructors for user-defined modules. Use `import MyModule exposing (..)` instead, or qualify constructors: `MyModule.MyConstructor`
- **`//` for integer division**: Use `//` or regular `/` — both work. `//` always returns `Int` (same operator as Elm), `modBy divisor n` returns `n % divisor`

## Code Formatting (`sky fmt`)

**Always run `sky fmt <file>.sky` after changes.** The formatter is opinionated, deterministic, no configuration options (output is Elm-compatible: 4-space indent, leading commas).

### Rules

- **4-space indentation** throughout (never tabs)
- **"One line or each on its own line"** — arguments, list items, record fields either all fit on one line or each gets its own line indented 4 spaces
- **Leading commas** for multi-line lists, records, and record types
- **Two blank lines** between top-level declarations
- **Trailing newline** at end of file

### Function Calls

```elm
-- Short: stays on one line
div [ class "container" ] [ text "hello" ]

-- Long: each arg on its own line, indented 4
someFunction
    arg1
    arg2
    arg3
```

### Pipelines

```elm
items
    |> List.map (\x -> x * 2)
    |> List.filter (\x -> x > 3)
    |> List.sort
```

### Boolean Chains

```elm
if condition1
    || condition2
    || condition3 then
    body

else
    fallback
```

### If-Then-Else

```elm
if condition then
    trueValue

else if otherCondition then
    otherValue

else
    fallback
```

### Case Expressions

```elm
case msg of

    Increment ->
        count + 1

    Decrement ->
        count - 1
```

### Let-In

```elm
let
    x = compute
    y = transform x
in
    result
```

### Records & Lists

```elm
-- Short: one line
{ name = "Alice" , age = 30 }
[ 1 , 2 , 3 ]

-- Long: leading commas
{ name = "Alice"
, age = 30
, email = "alice@example.com"
}

[ firstItem
, secondItem
, thirdItem
]
```

### Record Updates

```elm
{ model | name = newName , age = newAge }
```

### ADT Variants

```elm
type Shape
    = Circle Float
    | Rectangle Float Float
```

### Declarations

```elm
greet : String -> String
greet name =
    "Hello, " ++ name


add : Int -> Int -> Int
add a b =
    a + b
```

## Common Patterns

```elm
-- HTTP handler (with gorilla/mux)
handler w req =
    let
        body = Io.readAll (Http.requestBody req)
    in
    case body of
        Ok data -> writeResponse w data
        Err e -> writeResponse w (errorToString e)

-- Database query
getUsers db =
    case Sql.dbQueryToMaps db "SELECT * FROM users" [] of
        Ok rows -> rows
        Err _ -> []

-- JSON decoding with pipeline
type alias User = { name : String, age : Int }

-- Sky auto-generates `User : String -> Int -> User` from the type
-- alias above (v0.7.26+), so you can use it as a constructor directly:
userDecoder =
    Decode.succeed User    -- the type alias name IS the constructor
        |> Pipeline.required "name" Decode.string
        |> Pipeline.required "age" Decode.int

result = Decode.decodeString userDecoder jsonString
```

## New Compiler Additions (Haskell-based Sky compiler)

The following features are available in the new Haskell-based compiler.
Everything in the sections above still applies — this appends new surface.

### Safety Guarantees (on by default)

Every Sky program gets these out of the box with zero configuration:

| Attack vector | Defence |
|---------------|---------|
| SQL injection | `Std.Db` validates identifiers (Unicode-aware allow-list) and ANSI-quotes them; values always go through parameter placeholders |
| XSS | `String.htmlEscape`, auto-escape in `Sky.Live` VNode renderer, `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`, `isUrl` rejects `javascript:` / `data:` |
| CSRF / Clickjacking | `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN`, `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` sent by default |
| Path traversal | `Path.safeJoin root rel` |
| DoS (body size) | HTTP server caps request body at 32 MiB → 413; Live event body capped at 1 MiB; `File.readFile` caps at 100 MiB |
| DoS (timeouts) | ReadHeaderTimeout 10s, ReadTimeout 30s, WriteTimeout 30s, IdleTimeout 120s; HTTP client 30s |
| DoS (request rate) | `RateLimit.allow name key cap perSec` token-bucket |
| Command injection | `Process.run` uses argv; never shell interpretation |
| Timing attacks | `Crypto.constantTimeEqual` for comparing secrets; bcrypt is already constant-time |
| Weak randomness | `Crypto.randomBytes`/`randomToken`, `Uuid.v4`/`v7`, Sky.Live session IDs all use `crypto/rand` |
| Password brute force | bcrypt cost 12; `Auth.passwordStrength` validates ≥8 chars + letter + digit |
| Panic cascading | Every HTTP/Live/FFI handler wraps in `recover()` — returns 500/Err, process never crashes |
| Unicode correctness | `String.length/slice/left/right` are rune-based; `String.normalize` (NFC) + `graphemes` (UAX #29) available |

### New Standard Library Modules

#### `Std.Log` — structured logging

```elm
import Std.Log as Log

Log.info "server started"              -- human format: <timestamp> INFO server started
Log.warn "rate-limit hit"              -- goes to stderr
Log.error "db connection lost"         -- goes to stderr
Log.with "request completed"           -- with key-value context
    (Dict.fromList [("method", "GET"), ("status", 200)])
```

Configure via env vars (or sky.toml `[log] format = "json" / level = "info"`):
- `SKY_LOG_LEVEL` = `debug | info | warn | error` (default `info`)
- `SKY_LOG_FORMAT` = `plain` (default) or `json`

Three-layer precedence: env > `.env` > `sky.toml`. Set `SKY_LOG_FORMAT=json` in production to flip on JSON without a rebuild.

#### `Sky.Core.System` — typed environment + process state access

```elm
import Sky.Core.System as System

System.getenv     "DATABASE_URL"              -- Task Error String — Err on missing
System.getenvOr   "PORT"   "8080"             -- Task Error String — never errs
System.getenvInt  "WORKERS"                   -- Task Error Int    — Err on missing/parse
System.getenvBool "DEBUG"                     -- Task Error Bool   — true/yes/1/on or false/no/0/off
System.requireEnv -- removed; `getenv` already errors on missing
```

Pattern at module top-level (Task collapses with `Task.run`):
```elm
port _ =
    Task.run (System.getenvOr "PORT" "8080")
        |> Result.withDefault "8080"
```

#### `Sky.Core.Uuid`

```elm
import Sky.Core.Uuid as Uuid

Uuid.v4        -- Task Error String — RFC 4122 random (crypto/rand)
Uuid.v7        -- Task Error String — time-ordered (better for DB primary keys)
Uuid.parse s   -- Result Error String — canonicalise or reject
```

#### `Sky.Http.Middleware`

```elm
import Sky.Http.Server as Server
import Sky.Http.Middleware as M

main =
    Server.listen 8080
        [ Server.get "/" (M.withLogging (M.withCors ["*"] homeHandler))
        , Server.get "/admin" (M.withBasicAuth "alice" "secret" adminHandler)
        , Server.post "/api" (M.withRateLimit "api" 100 10 apiHandler)  -- 100 burst, 10/sec refill
        ]
```

#### `Sky.Http.RateLimit`

```elm
import Sky.Http.RateLimit as RL
RL.allow "login" userEmail 5 1   -- 5 attempts, 1/sec refill → Bool
```

#### `Std.Html` / `Std.Css` / `Std.Live` — web framework

```elm
import Std.Html exposing (..)
import Std.Html.Attributes exposing (..)
import Std.Live exposing (app, route)
import Std.Html.Events exposing (onClick)

type Msg = Increment | Decrement
type alias Model = { count : Int }

init _ = ({ count = 0 }, Cmd.none)

update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment -> ({ model | count = model.count + 1 }, Cmd.none)
        Decrement -> ({ model | count = model.count - 1 }, Cmd.none)

view model =
    div [ class "app" ]
        [ h1 [] [ text (String.fromInt model.count) ]
        , button [ onClick Decrement ] [ text "-" ]
        , button [ onClick Increment ] [ text "+" ]
        ]

main =
    app
        { init = init, update = update, view = view
        , subscriptions = \_ -> Sub.none
        , routes = [ route "/" () ], notFound = ()
        }
```

SSE subscriptions work out of the box:

```elm
subscriptions model =
    case model.page of
        CounterPage -> Sub.every 1000 Tick   -- tick every second via SSE
        _ -> Sub.none
```

#### `Sky.Ffi` — safe FFI to arbitrary Go packages

Sky's FFI has a strict effect boundary enforced at runtime:

```elm
import Sky.Ffi as Ffi
import Sky.Core.Task as Task

-- Effect-unknown (auto-generated): must use callTask
Task.perform (Ffi.callTask "github.com/pkg.DoThing" [arg1, arg2])

-- Hand-audited pure (only via rt.RegisterPure in hand-written ffi/*.go)
Ffi.callPure "mypkg.reverse" [str]   -- Result Error a
```

Workflow:
```bash
sky add github.com/stripe/stripe-go/v82     # auto-fetches + generates bindings
```

The generator:
- Emits `ffi/<slug>_bindings.go` with `rt.Register` calls
- Auto-discovers + imports all referenced Go packages (stdlib, parent packages)
- Every binding wraps in panic-recover → Err; never crashes process
- Generics (`Fetch[T]`) genuinely can't be realised — SKIPPED with clear comment

### New String Functions (Unicode-correct)

```elm
String.length "世界"          -- 2 (runes, not bytes)
String.graphemes "👨‍👩‍👧"    -- 1 (UAX #29 grapheme cluster, emoji family = 1 char)
String.normalize s            -- NFC canonical form (web standard)
String.normalizeNFD s         -- decomposed form (for diacritic-insensitive search)
String.equalFold a b          -- case-insensitive Unicode equality
String.casefold s             -- Unicode-aware lowercase for comparison
String.isValid s              -- True iff valid UTF-8
String.slugify s              -- URL-safe, Unicode-preserving
String.htmlEscape s           -- & < > " ' → HTML entities
String.truncate n s           -- cut at n graphemes (never mid-emoji)
String.ellipsize n s          -- truncate + "…"
String.isEmail s              -- RFC 5322 syntactic check
String.isUrl s                -- rejects javascript:/data: (XSS-safe)
String.trimStart / trimEnd    -- Unicode whitespace (NBSP, ideographic, etc.)
```

### New Time Functions

```elm
Time.formatISO8601 ms    -- "2026-04-12T14:30:00.000Z" (JSON-friendly)
Time.formatRFC3339 ms    -- like ISO but with nanos
Time.formatHTTP ms       -- HTTP-date header format
Time.parseISO8601 str    -- Result Error Int (unix millis)
Time.addMillis delta ms
Time.diffMillis later earlier
```

### New Crypto Functions

```elm
Crypto.sha256 "hello"                    -- hex digest (also sha512, sha1, md5)
Crypto.hmacSha256 "secret" "message"     -- hex HMAC (also hmacSha512)
Crypto.rsaSha256Sign pemKey "message"    -- Result Error String — RS256
Crypto.rsaSha256Verify pubKey msg sig    -- Bool
Crypto.constantTimeEqual a b             -- use for comparing secrets, NOT ==
Crypto.randomBytes 16                    -- Task Error String, hex
Crypto.randomToken 32                    -- Task Error String, URL-safe base64
```

### New Path Safety

```elm
Path.safeJoin "/var/www" "public/index.html"    -- Ok "/var/www/public/index.html"
Path.safeJoin "/var/www" "../../etc/passwd"     -- Err "safeJoin: path escapes root"
```

### `Std.Db` — SQLite + PostgreSQL

Auto-detects driver from connection string:

```elm
import Std.Db as Db

-- SQLite
db = Db.connect ":memory:"
db = Db.connect "/tmp/app.db"

-- PostgreSQL (pgx driver)
db = Db.connect "postgres://user:pw@localhost:5432/mydb?sslmode=disable"

-- All identifiers validated + ANSI-quoted; values parameterised
Db.insertRow db "users" (Dict.fromList [("email", "alice@example.com")])
Db.query db "SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = ?" ["alice@example.com"]
Db.getById db "users" 42
Db.updateById db "users" 42 (Dict.fromList [("role", "admin")])
```

### `Std.Auth`

```elm
import Std.Auth as Auth

Auth.register db email password          -- bcrypt cost 12, creates users table
Auth.login db email password             -- returns user row on success
Auth.hashPassword pw                     -- Result Error String (bcrypt, min 8, max 72 bytes)
Auth.passwordStrength pw                 -- Result Error () — validator
Auth.signToken secret claims expirySeconds -- HS256 JWT
Auth.verifyToken secret token            -- Result Error (Dict String any)
```

### Editor Integration

VS Code / Neovim / Emacs / Zed / Helix / Sublime all work via `sky lsp`.
Configure your editor to run `sky lsp` for `.sky` files.
The server provides:
- Diagnostics on save (type errors, parse errors)
- Hover with inferred types
- Completion (top-level defs + stdlib)

### Incremental Builds

Build artifacts cached in `.skycache/`. Source-hash-based: if no source files
have changed, Sky skips parse/canonicalise/type-check and reuses main.go.
Set `SKY_DCE=0` to disable dead-code elimination for debugging.

### FFI: How Generated Bindings Stay Safe

The generator uses **two runtime registries**:
- `rt.Register(name, fn)` — effect-unknown (default); only `Ffi.callTask`
- `rt.RegisterPure(name, fn)` — hand-audited pure; allows `Ffi.callPure`

Every auto-generated binding is effect-unknown. You get `Err "use callTask"`
if you try `callPure` on it — the runtime itself enforces Sky's effect
boundary. To promote an audited Go function to pure, write a hand-crafted
`ffi/<pkg>_pure.go` that calls `rt.RegisterPure` — it shadows the
auto-generated binding.

All FFI calls go through `defer/recover`: any Go panic becomes a Sky `Err`,
never a process crash.

### v0.15.47+ Stdlib Additions (Std.Cache / Std.Email / Std.Compression / Std.Csv / Std.Config)

Five new modules — every Sky app stops reinventing them.

- `Std.Cache` — typed LRU + TTL in-memory. `CacheCfg` ships with `defaultCfg` + `withMaxEntries`/`withTTL`/`withMaxBytes` builders per the v0.15.46 typed-record convention. API: `new` / `get` / `put` / `remove` / `clear` / `size` / `stats`. Backed by `hashicorp/golang-lru/v2`.
- `Std.Email` — Resend / SES / SendGrid / SMTP under one `EmailProvider` ADT. Typed `EmailMessage` + `Attachment` with `defaultMessage { from, to, subject }` + `with*` builders. `Email.send : EmailProvider -> EmailMessage -> Task Error String` returns the provider message id. `SKY_EMAIL_DRY_RUN=1` short-circuits for tests.
- `Std.Compression` — `gzip` / `gunzip` (RFC 1952) + `zstdCompress` / `zstdDecompress` (RFC 8478). Operates on `Bytes` (String alias).
- `Std.Csv` — `parse` / `parseWithDelimiter`, `encode` / `encodeWithDelimiter` (RFC 4180), `parseStreamFromFile` for large files. Returns typed `Csv = { header, rows }`.
- `Std.Config` — typed TOML / YAML / JSON decoders mirroring `Sky.Core.Json.Decode`'s shape. `decodeToml` / `decodeYaml` / `decodeJson` + `loadFromFile` (extension-detected).

### v0.15.47+ Additions to Existing Modules

- `String.containsIn / startsWithIn / endsWithIn` — **haystack-first** companions. The existing `String.contains needle haystack` was needle-first and broke `|>` chains. Now: `"hello world" |> String.containsIn "world"` reads naturally.
- `Sky.Core.Random` — `range`, `choice`, `shuffle`, `weighted` (entropy-backed Task) + `seed`, `seededInt`, `seededFloat`, `seededChoice` (deterministic splitmix64).

### Stdlib typed-record convention (v0.15.46+)

**Every typed record in Std.* ships with a `default<Name>` constructor + `with<Field>` builder helpers per field.** This makes adding fields non-breaking (downstream callers using builders auto-pick up new defaults). Always compose typed records via builders, not raw record literals:

```elm
-- Preferred (won't break when fields are added):
defaultCacheCfg
    |> withMaxEntries 1000
    |> withTTL 60000

-- Fragile (breaks the moment a field is added to CacheCfg):
{ maxEntries = 1000, ttlMs = 60000, maxBytes = 0 }
```
